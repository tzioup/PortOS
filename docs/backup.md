# Backup & Restore

PortOS backs up two things together, into a single timestamped snapshot:

1. **Filesystem data** — an rsync mirror of `./data/` (with SHA-256 manifest).
2. **PostgreSQL** — a `pg_dump` logical dump (`portos-db.sql`) written alongside the snapshot.

Now that PostgreSQL is a **required** dependency (it owns the creative catalog, memory, and a growing set of app-native records — see [Storage Classification Contract](storage.md)), **the database dump is part of required system state, not an optional extra.** A snapshot that captured `data/` but failed to capture the DB is incomplete, and PortOS surfaces that explicitly.

Implementation: `server/services/backup.js` (snapshot/dump/restore), `server/services/backupScheduler.js` (cron), `server/routes/backup.js` (API), and `server/routes/database.js` (DB export/sync).

## What gets backed up

A backup run (`runBackup` in `server/services/backup.js`) writes to:

```
<destPath>/snapshots/<hostname>/<snapshotId>/
├── data/             # rsync mirror of ./data/ (minus excludes)
├── portos-db.sql     # pg_dump logical dump
└── manifest.json     # SHA-256 of every data/ file AND ../portos-db.sql
```

* Snapshots are namespaced by `<hostname>` so one shared destination (e.g. an iCloud folder) can host backups from several federated machines without `snapshotId` collisions.
* The `manifest.json` hashes the SQL dump too (keyed as `../portos-db.sql`, since the dump lives one level above the `data/` tree), so a truncated or corrupt dump is detectable rather than silently trusted.

### What is excluded by default

`DEFAULT_EXCLUDES` (in `backup.js`) skips ephemeral/cache data and large re-downloadable assets — all anchored with a leading `/` (rsync filter syntax). Two tiers:

* **Non-overridable** (`overridable: false`): browser CDP profile, agent worktrees — caches with no irreplaceable user data; never backed up.
* **Overridable** (`overridable: true`): LoRA weight files, cloned repos, reference repos, browser downloads — re-downloadable; the user can opt back in from the Backup settings UI via `disabledDefaultExcludes`.

The effective exclude list is computed by the pure `computeEffectiveExcludes()` helper (unit-tested in `backup.test.js`). The scheduled cron handler in `backupScheduler.js` re-reads settings on every run, so `destPath`, `excludePaths`, `disabledDefaultExcludes`, and `enabled` all take effect on the next run without a restart. See [Scheduling & status](backup.md#scheduling--status) for how the cron registration itself tracks settings.

#### Why every exclude must be anchored with a leading `/`

`DEFAULT_EXCLUDES` is **rsync filter syntax** — the leading `/` means "relative to the transfer root". Without the anchor, `loras/*.safetensors` also matches any `loras/` directory nested anywhere under `data/`, silently dropping unrelated user data (e.g. `brain/.../loras/`). An unanchored pattern is a data-loss bug, not a style nit.

The two `overridable` tiers are enforced, not advisory. A hand-edited `settings.json` that lists a non-overridable path in `disabledDefaultExcludes` is silently dropped server-side; `computeEffectiveExcludes()` enforces both the overridable allow-list and `Array.isArray` guards for hand-edited settings. The Backup tab's toggle UI uses a `shadowsDefault()` helper that also catches broader custom patterns (`loras/`, `loras/**`, `/cos/`) so the "included" state never lies about rsync's actual behavior.

## The Postgres dump is mandatory, not optional

`dumpPostgres()` runs `pg_dump --no-owner --no-acl --clean --if-exists` and returns an explicit status (no silent failure):

| Result                                                                                                                      | Meaning                                                                                                                                   | Effect on backup                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `{ status: 'ok', sizeBytes, tableCount }`                                                                                   | Dump succeeded and is non-empty                                                                                                           | Backup `ok`                           |
| `{ status: 'failed', reason: 'pg_unreachable' \| 'pg_dump_missing' \| 'version_mismatch' \| 'dump_error' \| 'empty_dump' }` | Postgres is the active backend but the dump failed                                                                                        | Backup **`degraded`** + warning toast |
| `{ status: 'skipped', reason: 'not_configured' }`                                                                           | The explicit file escape hatch is active — `MEMORY_BACKEND=file` or the backend resolved to `file` (dev/test, unsupported for production) | Backup stays `ok` (benign)            |

Key behaviors, accurate to the code:

* **A failed dump degrades the whole backup.** `backupStatusForPg()` maps `failed → 'degraded'`; the run persists `pgBackup` into `data/backup/state.json` and emits a `BACKUP_DB_DUMP_FAILED` warning through the error pipeline — **even on unattended scheduled runs** (which pass `io = null`; the service falls back to the module-level `getIo()`).
* **A skipped dump is still benign** only for the temporary `MEMORY_BACKEND=file` escape hatch (documented as unsupported for production installs). On a normal install where Postgres is active or auto-detected, an unreachable DB returns `failed/pg_unreachable`, not a green "not configured" run.
* **`--clean --if-exists`** makes the dump replay cleanly into a live, already-initialized PortOS database — the common restore target — instead of erroring on `relation already exists`.
* A `pg_dump` that exits 0 but produces a 0-byte file is treated as `failed/empty_dump`; a non-zero exit deletes the partial file so a later restore can't trust a truncated dump.
* **`version_mismatch`** means no installed `pg_dump` is new enough for the running server (`pg_dump` aborts when older than the server it dumps — the common Homebrew case where an old `postgresql@NN` keg shadows a newer running server in `PATH`). `dumpPostgres()` reads the server's major version (`getServerMajorVersion()` in `lib/db.js`) and auto-selects the closest `pg_dump` whose major is `>=` the server from the installed Homebrew kegs / Postgres.app bundles. Set `PORTOS_PGDUMP=/path/to/pg_dump` to override the auto-discovered binary (e.g. on Linux/Windows where the keg locations don't apply).

## How restore works

Restore is two independent operations — restoring files and restoring the DB are separate decisions. Both are **dry-run by default** and validate `snapshotId` against path traversal before touching anything.

### Files — `restoreSnapshot()`

rsyncs `<snapshot>/data/` back to `./data/`. `dryRun: true` (the default) reports what would change without writing; an optional `subdirFilter` limits the restore to one subdirectory.

### Database — `restorePostgres()`

Replays the snapshot's `portos-db.sql` into the live database via `psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --single-transaction`, so the restore is **atomic**: it either fully applies or rolls back, never leaving a mixed snapshot/current state.

| Result                                                 | Meaning                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{ status: 'ok', dryRun, sizeBytes, tableCount }`      | Dry-run report, or a successful real restore                                                   |
| `{ status: 'skipped', reason: 'no_dump' }`             | No `portos-db.sql` in the snapshot (or 0 bytes)                                                |
| `{ status: 'skipped', reason: 'not_configured' }`      | Real restore requested but Postgres is unreachable — refuses to half-restore                   |
| `{ status: 'failed', reason: 'manifest_mismatch' }`    | Snapshot's `portos-db.sql` hash disagrees with `manifest.json` — dump considered untrustworthy |
| `{ status: 'failed', reason: 'restore_error', error }` | `psql` replay failed (stderr captured)                                                         |

A non-dry-run restore requires a reachable DB first (`checkHealth()`), so a restore never half-applies against a down database.

### Backend export / sync — `POST /api/database/sync`

Separate from snapshot restore: `server/routes/database.js` can copy data **between** the native (port 5432) and Docker (port 5561) Postgres backends. It exports the active backend with `pg_dump`, ensures the target backend has the `portos` role/database/extensions, then imports under `ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --single-transaction`. `POST /api/database/export` produces an on-demand dump under `data/db-dumps/`. These power the Database settings tab's mode-switch/sync flows; they are independent of the rsync snapshot backups above.

## Scheduling & status

* Daily backups are driven by `backupScheduler.js` via the `backup-daily` cron event; `getNextRunTime()` reports the next run.
* **The registration tracks settings — no restart needed.** `syncBackupSchedule()` runs at boot _and_ on every settings save (subscribed to `settingsEvents`' `settings:updated`), so enabling backups or setting `destPath` when scheduling was previously inactive registers the cron immediately, editing `cronExpression` re-registers it, and disabling backups (or clearing `destPath`) cancels it. A save that doesn't change the registration inputs (cron expression, timezone, active/inactive) is a no-op — `destPath` and the exclude lists are re-read by the handler per run, so changing them never churns the registration.
* `GET /api/backup/status` surfaces the persisted state including the last `pgBackup` outcome, so the Backup settings tab shows whether the last DB dump succeeded, its size, and table count.
