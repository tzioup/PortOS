# API Reference

PortOS exposes a REST API on port 5555 and WebSocket events via Socket.IO.

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:5555/api
```

When a TLS cert is provisioned (`npm run setup:cert`), `:5555` serves HTTPS instead and a loopback-only HTTP mirror runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5553` for local scripts. See [PORTS.md](./PORTS.md).

This document covers the most commonly used endpoints plus a [route-domain index](#route-domain-index). The in-app **API Explorer** at `/api-reference/catalog` is the exhaustive, generated reference:

For the bridge between these HTTP/event inventories and model-facing tools,
see [API and MCP Unified Tool Contract](./API_TOOL_CONTRACT.md). It records
the shipped semantic registry, MCP context/action schemas, authority matrix,
and the current-vs-proposed boundary.

- `GET /api/api-docs/catalog.json` — searchable metadata for every mounted HTTP operation.
- `GET /api/api-docs/internal/openapi.json` — OpenAPI 3.0.3 for the complete internal HTTP surface.
- `GET /api/api-docs/openapi.json` — OpenAPI 3.0.3 for only the external APIs currently exposed in Settings.
- `GET /api/api-docs/events.json` — searchable Socket.IO event inventory.
- `GET /api/api-docs/asyncapi.json` — AsyncAPI 3 for the Socket.IO transport.
- `GET /api/api-docs/tools.min.json` — the minimized semantic tool resource: only the operations annotated `x-portos-tool`, flattened to provider-neutral tool records with an HTTP binding. Sized for an agent to read whole, unlike the full internal document.

Inferred entries are explicitly marked `generated` until a runtime-backed payload contract exists; detailed entries are marked `modeled`. Regenerate the checked-in HTTP route manifest with `npm run generate:api-docs`. Socket.IO events are derived from source on first use and cached for the server process, so event declarations have no checked-in manifest or regeneration step.

When adding an HTTP route, keep its request Zod schema in a reusable server library and register the detailed documentation in `server/lib/apiOperationContracts.js`; the route and OpenAPI should consume the same schema object. Add an `x-portos-tool` annotation to that contract entry to also publish the operation as an agent-callable tool in `tools.min.json`, and declare the codes its error responses really throw in `x-portos-error-codes` — the HTTP status alone does not identify the code, since `errorHandler` prefers an explicit `err.code` over the status map. Socket payload schemas follow the same pattern in `server/lib/socketEventContracts.js`. The HTTP generator and live Socket.IO source inventory guarantee coverage, while these small registries make richer contracts incremental without maintaining a second handwritten list of paths or events.

Building a native companion client? See [COMPANION_APP_API.md](./COMPANION_APP_API.md) — the stable, pre-auth-discoverable contract (discovery/identity, HTTP Basic auth, instance management, palette actions, daily-log, POST progress, and the iCloud-sync precedent) that the PortDeck app consumes.

## Security Model

PortOS is designed for personal/developer use on trusted networks. It implements the following security measures:

- **Network isolation**: By default, access should be restricted to trusted networks (e.g., Tailscale VPN, localhost)
- **Command allowlist**: Shell command execution is restricted to an approved allowlist (see `server/lib/commandSecurity.js`)
- **Input validation**: All API inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- **Opt-in authentication**: Off by default (trusting private network/Tailscale), PortOS supports opt-in instance password authentication (enforced by `server/services/authGate.js`) gating `/api/*`, `/data/*`, and `/sdapi/*` via session cookies, Bearer tokens, or HTTP Basic credentials

**Important**: Do not expose PortOS APIs directly to untrusted networks. For production deployments, consider:
- Binding to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`
- Enabling instance password authentication in Settings → Security
- Running behind an authenticated reverse proxy
- Using Tailscale or similar VPN for remote access

## REST Endpoints

### System

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/system/capabilities` | Host-local platform, architecture, Apple Silicon, memory, CPU, and cached CUDA capability snapshot used to filter model/provider selections. Probe failures remain `unknown`; this payload is intentionally not included in federation health records. |

### Federated peer-probe contract

PortOS peers running independently upgraded installs use the following existing
endpoints during the periodic reachability probe in
`server/services/instances.js`. They are a **frozen compatibility contract**:
keep their paths, request semantics, and listed response fields compatible.
Additive response fields are allowed. A breaking change needs a new, explicitly
versioned endpoint and a staged migration of the probe; `schemaVersions.js`
gates synchronized records, not these request/response contracts.

All three requests use the configured peer HTTP Basic credential when the
remote instance enables its optional password gate. They are not a general
cross-install data channel: probe results are stored only as the local peer's
health, app, and sync snapshots. Do not add personal records, peer lists,
credentials, local paths, or build identity to these responses.

| Method | Endpoint | Stable request and response contract |
|--------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| GET | `/system/health/details` | Returns an object containing `instanceId` and `version` (each may be `null`) for peer identity and compatibility display. The health summary remains an object so an older prober can retain it as its last-known health snapshot. |
| GET | `/apps` | Returns either the legacy app array or `{ apps: [...] }`. Each app entry used by peers retains `id`, `name`, `icon`, `overallStatus`, `uiPort`, `apiPort`, and `type`; fields may be absent or `null` when unknown. |
| GET | `/instances/sync-status?forPeer=<instance-id>` | `forPeer` is optional and remains lenient: an unknown or legacy identifier, blank value, or omitted value must degrade to the unscoped status response rather than fail the probe. A recognized peer receives its `cursorForYou` alongside the normal sync status. |

The separate `/federation/media/v1` surface is already versioned and has its
own wire contract in [FEDERATED_MEDIA_PROVIDERS.md](./FEDERATED_MEDIA_PROVIDERS.md).

### Apps

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/apps` | List all registered apps |
| POST | `/apps` | Register a new app |
| GET | `/apps/:id` | Get app details |
| PUT | `/apps/:id` | Update app |
| DELETE | `/apps/:id` | Unregister app |
| POST | `/apps/:id/start` | Start app via PM2 |
| POST | `/apps/:id/stop` | Stop app via PM2 |
| POST | `/apps/:id/restart` | Restart app via PM2 |
| GET | `/apps/:id/status` | Get PM2 status |
| GET | `/apps/:id/logs` | Get recent logs |
| POST | `/apps/:id/refresh-config` | Re-parse ecosystem config |

### Processes & Logs

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/logs/processes` | List all PM2 processes |
| GET | `/logs/:name` | Get logs for process |
| GET | `/ports/scan` | Scan for active ports |

### AI Providers

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/providers` | List all AI providers. Also returns `runnerAllowedCommands` — the CoS Agent Runner's exec allowlist, read-only, so the editor can warn that a custom `command` won't spawn via `/spawn` / `/spawn-tui`. |
| POST | `/providers` | Add new provider |
| PUT | `/providers/:id` | Update provider |
| DELETE | `/providers/:id` | Delete provider |
| POST | `/providers/:id/test` | Test provider connectivity |
| PUT | `/providers/active` | Set active provider |
| GET | `/providers/runtimes` | Per-runtime install status (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `grok`, `kimi`, `agy`, `cursor-agent`): is the binary runnable here, and can PortOS install it? Booleans and labels only — never resolved filesystem paths. 60s TTL cache. Ollama / LM Studio are absent on purpose — Models → LLMs owns their install. |
| POST | `/providers/runtimes/install?runtime=<id>` | Install one runtime from the installer's fixed table, streaming installer output as SSE. Rejects any id not in the table. |
| GET | `/providers/readiness` | Requirements checklist per provider backed by a LOCAL daemon (llama.cpp / Ollama / LM Studio / MTPLX), keyed by provider id: is the daemon installed, is it answering at the endpoint THIS provider points at, and is it serving the provider's default model. Each entry also carries `setup` — what the one-click fix below can do about the unmet checks (`null` when nothing is auto-fixable here). Providers with no local dependency are absent from the map. Complements `/providers/runtimes` (which answers "can PortOS run this CLI?"). Booleans, labels, and the provider's own endpoint only — never a resolved binary path. Skips disabled providers; 15s endpoint-probe cache (one probe per distinct endpoint), 60s binary-PATH cache, both dropped by the llama-server start/stop/install routes. |
| POST | `/providers/readiness/setup?provider=<id>` | Install and/or start the LOCAL DAEMON that provider points at (llama.cpp / Ollama / LM Studio / MTPLX), streaming progress as SSE — the "do it for me" half of `/providers/readiness`, so an unmet requirement is fixed from the card instead of from a vendor setup doc. The request names a PROVIDER only: the runtime kind and endpoint are re-derived server-side from the stored record, so no query value reaches a spawn argument (an optional `runtime=` is cross-checked and 409s on a mismatch). Every command comes from a fixed per-runtime table. Never downloads model weights, never starts llama-server (it needs a checkpoint you choose), and never runs MTPLX's privileged fan-control helper. Single-flight. |
| POST | `/providers/readiness/serve-model?provider=<id>` | Relaunch the local daemon so it answers under the model id THIS provider sends — the other half of the readiness model mismatch. `llama-server` serves one model per process under the `--alias` on its launch line, so the fix keeps the loaded weights and changes only the name; the whole launch line is carried forward and the previous one restored if the relaunch is rejected or never answers. The model id is re-derived server-side from the stored record. 400s for a runtime that has no such label (Ollama / LM Studio / MTPLX name a model after its weights), 409s when PortOS did not start the daemon. |
| GET | `/providers/codex/account?fresh=1` | Is a ChatGPT subscription signed in, and usable right now? Answers `{ readiness }` with a `status` of `runtime-missing` / `unknown` / `signed-out` / `login-pending` / `ready` / `quota-exhausted` / `reauth-required`, plus the plan name and quota percentages. Read from the Codex app-server's own `account/read` — PortOS never opens Codex's credential file and the payload carries no token, account id, or credential path. This is the ONLY call that may spawn `codex app-server`, and it runs from an explicit page fetch: nothing on the boot path calls it, and `GET /providers` decorates its Codex cards from the cached snapshot only. `fresh=1` skips the 15s TTL for the poll after a sign-in. |
| POST | `/providers/codex/account/login` | Start an explicit ChatGPT sign-in. Returns `{ login }` — a bounded `loginId` plus `authUrl` (browser flow) or `verificationUrl` + `userCode` (device-code flow, via `{ "deviceCode": true }`). A POST because it begins an OAuth flow; never a side effect of a read. 409s while another sign-in is already pending. |
| POST | `/providers/codex/account/login/cancel` | Abandon the pending sign-in named by `{ loginId }`, then re-read. 409s for an id that is not the pending login, so a stale tab cannot cancel a flow the user started afterwards. |
| POST | `/providers/codex/account/logout` | Sign out of ChatGPT and re-read. Codex drops its own credentials; PortOS holds none to clear. |
| GET | `/providers/codex/models?fresh=1` | Which models this ChatGPT subscription may run, from the app-server's own `model/list` rather than a hard-coded table. Answers `{ models, fetchedAt, error }`. The sentinels are load-bearing: `models: null` = NEVER FETCHED, `[]` = fetched and the plan genuinely has none, and a failed read returns the LAST-KNOWN-GOOD list alongside `error` — so one timeout can never empty the picker. Lazy like `/codex/account`; `fresh=1` skips the 10m TTL after a plan change or a sign-in. |
| GET | `/providers/opencode/installation` | **Legacy alias**, kept so a stale client bundle still renders: `{ installed, npmAvailable }` for the `opencode` runtime. New code uses `/providers/runtimes`. |
| POST | `/providers/opencode/install` | **Legacy alias** for `/providers/runtimes/install?runtime=opencode`. |

## WebSocket Events

Connect to Socket.IO at `http://localhost:5555`.

The complete source-derived event list is visible in **API Explorer → Event API** and available at `GET /api/api-docs/asyncapi.json` as AsyncAPI 3. The examples below highlight common flows rather than serving as the exhaustive inventory.

### Log Streaming

```javascript
// Subscribe to process logs
socket.emit('logs:subscribe', { processName: 'portos-server', lines: 100 });

// Receive log lines
socket.on('logs:line', ({ processName, line }) => {
  console.log(`[${processName}] ${line}`);
});

// Unsubscribe
socket.emit('logs:unsubscribe', { processName: 'portos-server' });
```

### Error Notifications

Server errors are broadcast to all connected sockets — no subscription handshake is needed.

```javascript
// Receive error events
socket.on('error:occurred', (error) => {
  console.error('Server error:', error.message, error.code);
});
```

### Chief of Staff Events

```javascript
// Join the CoS room to receive agent lifecycle events
socket.emit('cos:subscribe');

socket.on('cos:agent:spawned', (agent) => {
  console.log('Agent spawned:', agent.id, agent.task);
});

socket.on('cos:agent:updated', (agent) => {
  console.log('Agent updated:', agent.id, agent.status);
});

socket.on('cos:agent:completed', (agent) => {
  console.log('Agent completed:', agent.id, agent.success);
});

socket.on('cos:agent:output', ({ agentId, lines }) => {
  console.log('Agent output:', agentId, lines);
});
```

### Memory Events

```javascript
socket.on('memory:created', (memory) => {
  console.log('Memory created:', memory.id);
});

socket.on('memory:updated', (memory) => {
  console.log('Memory updated:', memory.id);
});

socket.on('memory:deleted', ({ id }) => {
  console.log('Memory deleted:', id);
});
```

### App Detection (Streaming)

```javascript
// Start streaming detection
socket.emit('detect:start', { path: '/path/to/repo' });

// Receive discovery steps
socket.on('detect:step', (step) => {
  console.log('Discovered:', step.field, step.value);
});

// Detection complete
socket.on('detect:complete', (appData) => {
  console.log('Detection complete:', appData);
});
```

### Shell Terminal

> **Security**: The shell WebSocket API provides full terminal access as the PortOS process user. It relies on PortOS's network-level access control (see [Security Model](#security-model)) — do not expose the PortOS server to untrusted networks.

```javascript
// Start a shell session — the server assigns the id and replies with shell:started
socket.emit('shell:start', {});
socket.on('shell:started', ({ sessionId }) => console.log('session', sessionId));

// Send input to shell. Submit with `\r` (the byte Enter sends), never `\n` — cmd.exe
// under Windows ConPTY ignores LF and the line is typed but never executed.
socket.emit('shell:input', { sessionId, data: 'ls -la\r' });

// Receive shell output
socket.on('shell:output', ({ sessionId, data }) => {
  console.log(data); // Terminal output
});

// Change directory — send the PATH, not a command. The server renders the `cd` for
// the shell this session runs (`cd /d "…"` on cmd.exe, Set-Location on PowerShell).
socket.emit('shell:cd', { sessionId, path: '/path/to/app' });

// Resize terminal
socket.emit('shell:resize', { sessionId, cols: 120, rows: 40 });

// Stop shell session
socket.emit('shell:stop', { sessionId });
```

### Provider Status

```javascript
// Provider availability changed
socket.on('provider:status:changed', ({ providerId, status, reason }) => {
  console.log(`Provider ${providerId}: ${status}`, reason);
});
```

## Request Examples

### Register an App

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5555/api/apps \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My App",
    "repoPath": "/path/to/repo",
    "uiPort": 3000,
    "apiPort": 3001,
    "pm2ProcessNames": ["myapp-server", "myapp-client"]
  }'
```

### Execute AI Run

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5555/api/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "List all files in the current directory",
    "workspacePath": "/path/to/workspace"
  }'
```

### Get PM2 Process Logs

```bash
curl http://localhost:5555/api/logs/portos-server?lines=50
```

## Error Responses

All errors return JSON with consistent structure:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "timestamp": 1704067200000,
  "context": {}
}
```

Common error codes:
- `NOT_FOUND` - Resource not found
- `VALIDATION_ERROR` - Invalid request data
- `COMMAND_NOT_ALLOWED` - Shell command not in allowlist
- `INTERNAL_ERROR` - Server error
