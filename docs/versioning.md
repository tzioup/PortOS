# Versioning & Release Process

## Version Format

PortOS uses semantic versioning: **Major.Minor.Patch**

| Component | Description          | When Incremented                |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Major** | Breaking changes     | Via `/do:release` slash command |
| **Minor** | New features         | Via `/do:release` slash command |
| **Patch** | Bug fixes, refactors | Via `/do:release` slash command |

Example progression: `0.22.0` → `0.22.1` (fix) → `0.23.0` (feature) → `1.0.0` (breaking)

## Branches

| Branch    | Purpose                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main`    | Active development                                          |
| `release` | Push `main` to `release` to trigger GitHub Release workflow |

## Workflow

### Version Bumping

Version is managed by the `/do:release` Claude Code slash command (provided by the [slashdo](https://github.com/atomantic/slashdo) skill). Do not bump `package.json` version manually during development.

### On Push/PR to `main`

CI runs tests and linting. No version changes.

### On Push `main` → `release`

1. Release workflow triggers
2. Creates git tag with current version (e.g., `v1.31.0`)
3. Generates GitHub release with changelog (priority: exact `.changelog/v{version}.md` → pattern `.changelog/v{major}.{minor}.x.md` → fallback commit log)
4. If a pattern changelog file (`.changelog/v{major}.{minor}.x.md`) was used, archives it by renaming to the exact version file on `main`
5. If the archive step ran, fast-forwards `release` to match `main`

### Regular Development

```bash
# Work on main or feature branches
git checkout main
git pull

# Make changes, commit with a human-readable message (this becomes the
# release-note source — no changelog file or fragment to write)
git add [changed files]
git commit -m "fix: daily log no longer double-saves on blur"
git pull --rebase --autostash && git push
```

See [`.changelog/README.md`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/.changelog/README.md) — release notes are synthesized from commit history by `/do:release`, not staged during development.

### Creating a Release

Use the `/do:release` slash command from `main`. It handles version bumping, changelog finalization, and pushing to the `release` branch.

## CI Skip

Use `[skip ci]` in commit messages to prevent CI from running (used by automation for changelog archives).
