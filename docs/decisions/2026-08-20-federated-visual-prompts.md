# ADR: Federated Image/Video Prompts May Cross to a Peer; Status Payloads Never May

* **Date:** 2026-08-20
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Related:** issue #4682 (this record), epic #4348 (federated media providers), PRs #4674 / #4676 (the image/video wire and peer-routed renders), [`server/lib/validation.js`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/server/lib/validation.js) (`federatedMediaImageJobSubmissionSchema`, `federatedMediaVideoJobSubmissionSchema`), [`docs/FEDERATED_MEDIA_PROVIDERS.md`](../federated_media_providers.md), ADR [privacy records machine-local](2026-08-08-privacy-records-machine-local.md) (#2148).

## Context

`AGENTS.md` states flatly that **PII must not ride the federation layer at all**, pointing at the privacy-records ADR. Read literally against the federated media wire, that rule looks violated: a federated image or video job carries its `prompt` to the peer as submitted, and a Creative Director / Creative Commission prompt is generated from project records — it can embed universe canon, character names, and other personal app data.

Audio is the exception in the other direction. A federated audio submission is rejected unless its prompt is a canonical string rendered from a fixed style/mood/instrument profile (`isFederatedMediaAudioPrompt`), and lyrics are refused outright. That asymmetry is deliberate, but until now it was justified only by a comment on the schema — so every reviewer who reads the flat rule against the visual path re-raises the same contradiction, and every answer is reconstructed from scratch.

This ADR writes the boundary down so the rule and its one scoped carve-out are readable together.

## Decision

**A submitted job body may carry the prompt the user (or their project) asked to render. A status or capability payload may never carry prompt or record content. Those are two different payload classes, and the "no PII on federation" rule governs the second.**

Concretely:

1. **Image and video prompts cross as submitted.** `federatedMediaImageJobSubmissionSchema` and `federatedMediaVideoJobSubmissionSchema` accept the prompt (and negative prompt) verbatim, bounded only by length. There is no fixed-vocabulary re-rendering, because there is no closed taxonomy for arbitrary visual or motion content the way audio has a finite style/mood/instrument alphabet. A render is _defined by_ its prompt; a peer that cannot read the prompt cannot do the work at all, so "render this remotely" and "the prompt stays home" are mutually exclusive for this kind.
2. **Audio stays fixed-vocabulary.** Music prompts and lyrics are free-form natural language whose whole purpose is to carry words, and a finite profile alphabet _does_ exist for instrumental style. Where a privacy-safe canonical form is available at no expressive cost, it is required. Remote lyrical conditioning stays unsolved and unshipped (see #4348).
3. **Status and capability payloads stay absolutely prompt-free.** `GET /api/federation/media/v1/status` returns allowlisted engine/model pairs, readiness signals, queue depth and staleness — never a prompt, a job body, a record excerpt, or a filename derived from one. The owner-scoped job projection is likewise a sanitized status view. This is the line that must not move, and it is the line `AGENTS.md`'s rule is protecting.
4.  **The counterparty is not an anonymous third party.** Sending is gated on _local_ configuration, not on the peer asking nicely: the peer record must be enabled, enabled as a media provider, and carry this exact kind/engine/model in the per-peer allowlist the local user configured (`assertFederatedMediaProviderSelection`), and a peer credential can only be entered locally — never learned from an inbound announce (`server/services/instances.js`). On the receiving side the provider surface refuses anything that is not a verified Basic credential from an enabled registered peer (`authorizeFederatedMediaPeer`), which means an install with the optional instance password _off_ cannot accept a federated job at all. That is what makes the carve-out scoped rather than general: it authorizes sending a prompt to a peer this install's own settings enable and allowlist for this kind of work, not to the internet and not to a cloud provider's account. The _record_ alone is not the consent — an inbound announce can create an enabled peer row on its own. The allowlist is, because an announced peer arrives with no media-provider config and stays refused until the local user gives it one.

    Two limits of that identity are real and are not fixed by this ADR: the Basic credential authenticates _the install_, not one peer, and the `X-PortOS-Instance-Id` header naming which registered peer is calling is self-asserted. So the guarantee is "a holder of this provider's instance password, on this private network" rather than a cryptographic binding to one allowlisted machine — a least-disclosure boundary between cooperating peers, as `docs/FEDERATED_MEDIA_PROVIDERS.md` already states. Tightening that benefits every federated surface and is tracked with the transport work, not here.
5.  **Unattended routing does not widen the audience, but it must be gated on a tailnet peer.** A configured route names one peer, one kind and one model, so the same prompts reach the same allowlisted machine — what changes is review cadence. It may never fan out to peers the allowlist does not cover, never fall back to a different peer on failure, and never relax rules 1–3.

    One thing does change enough to need its own gate. A standing route exports every future prompt of its kind without a human looking, so a misconfigured counterparty is a permanent leak where an interactive mistake is a one-time one — and `peerFetch`'s `rejectUnauthorized: false` posture leaves a plain-LAN or non-`.ts.net` peer with no server authentication at all (see the HTTPS bullet in `AGENTS.md`). Authentication does not save this: the prompt rides the request body, so an impostor holding the connection reads it before it fails to answer. When unattended routing ships, a route whose peer is not recognized as a tailnet host must be refused, naming the reason (see Consequences for why that check needs its own predicate rather than a re-export of the probe-deferral one). Interactive routing is unchanged.

### Local input assets are out of scope, and stay out

Init/reference images, keyframes, clips to extend and LoRA weights do not cross the wire at all: a federated request carrying any of them is rejected with `400 MEDIA_PROVIDER_INPUT_UNSUPPORTED`. That is a capability limit today rather than a privacy decision, but the privacy consequence is real — a reference photo is a far denser personal payload than a text prompt. Input-asset transfer is a later slice of #4348 and must revisit this ADR before shipping.

## Alternatives considered

* **Render visual prompts from a fixed vocabulary, like audio.** Rejected: there is no such vocabulary. Any enum expressive enough to describe an arbitrary shot is a natural language, and any enum small enough to be privacy-safe cannot express what the user asked for. It would not protect the prompt so much as discard it.
* **Strip or redact names before submitting.** Rejected: it makes renders silently wrong. A universe's character names are frequently the _subject_ of the image, so redaction produces a plausible render of the wrong thing — the same failure mode the wire already refuses to accept for dropped init images.
* **Make the instance password a precondition.** Not an alternative — it already is one, on the receiving side. `authorizeFederatedMediaPeer` demands a `method: 'basic'`, `authenticated: true` context, and `authGate` only ever produces that after verifying the instance password, so a provider running the default passwordless posture rejects every federated job with `MEDIA_PROVIDER_PEER_AUTH_REQUIRED`. No prompt crosses to an unauthenticated install today, and this ADR does not relax that. It also does not make the stronger per-peer binding described in rule 4 a precondition — that gap is not prompt-specific, so blocking this decision on it would fix nothing here.
* **Forbid federated visual rendering entirely.** Rejected: it deletes the feature to protect data from the user's own second machine, which is where the data already lives — the peer is allowlisted for this work precisely because it is trusted with it.

## Consequences

* Privacy Center records are unaffected: nothing here adds a federated kind, a sync category, or a wire version. `AGENTS.md` and the privacy-records ADR link here rather than re-arguing the carve-out, and the schemas and route fields stop restating the rationale inline, so a reviewer's objection has one citable answer instead of four paraphrases.
* Rule 5's tailnet gate needs a predicate of its own. `peerRequiresTailscale()` (`server/services/instances.js`) is the right _shape_, but it is module-private and its job is probe deferral — an availability heuristic that a future polling-noise fix is free to loosen. Re-exporting it as a security gate would let that loosening silently widen this boundary, so the slice shipping unattended routing owns a deliberate predicate rather than a borrowed one.
* Rule 3 is enforced, not just asserted: a guard in `server/services/federatedMediaProvider.test.js` submits a job per kind and fails if its prompt reaches the status payload or either job projection.
* Any future federated kind must be classified against rules 1–3 before it ships: is its payload a _submission_ (may carry what the work is) or a _status_ (may not carry anything)? A kind whose free-form content has a privacy-safe canonical form should adopt audio's pattern rather than the visual one.

## Revisiting

Widening the carve-out requires a new ADR, not a reading of this one — in particular input-asset transfer, or relaying through anything that is not a PortOS instance this install has allowlisted for that kind of work.
