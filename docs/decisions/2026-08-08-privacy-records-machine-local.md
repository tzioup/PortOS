# ADR: Privacy Center Records Stay Machine-Local — Never Federated

* **Date:** 2026-08-08
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Related:** issue #2148 (closes the federation half; household subjects split out), epic #2138, [design record](../plans/2026-07-04-privacy-center-pii-vault-broker-optout.md), [`server/lib/vaultCrypto.js`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/server/lib/vaultCrypto.js), [`server/services/sharing/peerSync.js`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/server/services/sharing/peerSync.js), [`docs/STORAGE.md`](../storage.md), ADR [tribe + universe-runs local](2026-06-26-tribe-and-universe-runs-local.md) (#1724), ADR [federated visual prompts](2026-08-20-federated-visual-prompts.md) (#4682).

## Context

The Privacy Center (epic #2138) shipped Phases 1–8: an AES-256-GCM encrypted PII vault, a trusted-organization registry with per-field holdings, a change-of-address inventory, and an unbroker-style data-broker opt-out engine. All nine tables (`privacy_subjects`, `privacy_vault_records`, `privacy_consents`, `privacy_orgs`, `privacy_org_holdings`, `privacy_change_events`, `privacy_brokers`, `privacy_broker_cases`) are `db-primary` PostgreSQL and machine-local.

Federation was deliberately excluded from v1 and parked in #2148, whose proposal was: copy the same `PRIVACY_VAULT_KEY` to every peer, sync `privacy_vault_records` with the ciphertext travelling as-is, and sync orgs + holdings as **plain** records. This ADR resolves that parked question.

## What federating them would actually mean today

Three properties of the current federation layer make the parked proposal unsafe as written:

1. **The pull path carries no peer identity.** `GET /api/peer-sync/record?kind=&id=` calls `getRecordPayloadForPeer(kind, id)` with no notion of _who_ is asking. The `peerAllowsOutbound` / `peerHasCategory` checks gate only the **push** direction (`server/services/sharing/peerSyncPush.js`). Adding a privacy kind to `PEER_SUBSCRIBABLE_KINDS` would therefore not create a _subscription_ — it would create a read anyone who can reach the port can perform. When the optional instance password is off (the default posture), that is every host on the tailnet.
2. **Everything federated today is creative work.** `PEER_SUBSCRIBABLE_KINDS` is `universe, series, mediaCollection, author, artist, album, track, creativeDirectorProject, moodBoard, writersRoomWork, writersRoomFolder, writersRoomExercise, musicVideoProject, commissionFeedback, creativeCommission` — zero PII, zero credentials. The transport's trust posture (`peerHttpClient.js` sets `rejectUnauthorized: false`, commented "Tailnet is the trust boundary") was chosen for that data class. Between two tailnet nodes WireGuard already provides mutual authentication and confidentiality, so the un-validated TLS layer is redundant rather than dangerous — but `peerRequiresTailscale()` (`server/services/instances.js`) shows a peer may equally be a plain LAN IP or a non-tailnet DNS host, where nothing authenticates the far end.
3. **Ciphertext-only sync still leaks a PII fingerprint.** `masked_value` is a precomputed **plaintext** column by design (`•••, Portland, OR`, `j•••@example.com`, `••••1234`). A "ciphertext travels as-is" sync ships the whole mask set. Separately, `privacy_orgs` is the user's banks, employers, medical providers and insurers, and `privacy_broker_cases.evidence` holds `listing_urls` — the map of where the user is exposed. The parked proposal would have synced those as plain records.

A shared `PRIVACY_VAULT_KEY` also converts the at-rest guarantee from "one machine's `.env`" to "N machines' `.env` files," which is precisely the blast radius the encryption layer exists to bound.

## Decision

**No Privacy Center record federates. All eight tables are machine-local, and that is an intentional product guarantee — not a missing feature.**

Concretely, and permanently unless this ADR is superseded:

* No privacy kind is added to `PEER_SUBSCRIBABLE_KINDS`.
* No privacy category is added to `dataSync`'s `CATEGORIES`.
* No privacy table gains a `sync_sequence` cursor or `deleted`/`deleted_at` tombstone. Deletes stay hard deletes.
* No privacy category is added to `PORTOS_SCHEMA_VERSIONS` — there is no wire contract to version, because there is no wire.

A guard test (`server/services/sharing/privacyNeverFederates.test.js`) enforces the first two so the boundary fails loudly rather than eroding.

### Scope of the rule this ADR states

`AGENTS.md` summarizes this decision as the flat rule that **PII must not ride the federation layer at all**, and for Privacy Center records that is exact and unconditional. The rule governs _records_ — what one instance replicates to another, and what a status or capability payload may disclose. It is not a rule that no user-authored text may ever be addressed to a peer: its one scoped carve-out, submitted image/video job bodies, is decided in ADR [federated visual prompts](2026-08-20-federated-visual-prompts.md) (#4682).

### Why not "federate, but gate it on HTTPS + the instance password"

This was seriously considered, and the machinery for it already exists: the optional instance password (`server/services/auth.js` + `server/services/authGate.js`) gates all of `/api/*` including `/api/peer-sync/*`; per-peer Basic credentials are stored on the peer record and attached to every outbound hop by `peerFetch` (`server/lib/peerHttpClient.js`); and `GET /api/auth/status` is always-public, so a peer probe can _detect_ whether the far end requires auth and refuse to send otherwise.

It was rejected for the vault because the cost/benefit is poor, not because it is unimplementable:

* **The benefit is thin.** Durability is already covered — the DB is in the backup, and `PRIVACY_VAULT_KEY` lives in `.env`. The opt-out ledger is single-writer by design (#2148 flagged this itself); replicating it invites two peers to double-submit opt-outs against the same broker, which is worse than not syncing. The genuine multi-machine want — "see my vault on the laptop" — is satisfied by restoring a backup and copying one key, a deliberate, auditable, one-time act.
* **The cost is a permanent widening of the highest-value target in the install.** The instance password is a single credential granting the _entire_ API (shell, agents, providers), not a scoped capability. Making an SSN vault reachable over any network path, behind any single shared secret, trades a hard guarantee ("this data has never left this machine") for a soft one ("this data is protected as well as our weakest peer's password"). For PII specifically, the hard guarantee is worth more than the convenience.
* **Precedent.** `tribe_people` — a personal relationship/CRM graph — is already intentionally machine-local (ADR #1724), mirroring `memorySync.js`'s "relationship data is instance-local" boundary. An identity vault holding SSN, passport, driver's licence and financial-account numbers is a strictly stronger case than the one already decided.

The transport-hardening idea is worth keeping on its own merits, independent of privacy data: adding per-peer identity + category authorization to the pull path benefits **every** federated kind. That is tracked separately (see Consequences) and is explicitly _not_ a precondition for revisiting this decision — it is a fix for the creative-data federation that already exists.

## Consequences

* The Privacy Center is single-machine. The UI and docs should state this as a guarantee, so users understand the vault's contents have never traversed a network from PortOS.
* A user wanting the vault on a second machine restores from backup and copies `PRIVACY_VAULT_KEY` by hand. This is documented, not automated — a manual key copy is a moment of deliberate consent, which continuous replication is not.
* Household subjects (the other half of #2148) is unaffected: it is a same-machine, multi-subject feature with no federation dependency, and is split into **#3658**.
* Per-peer authorization on the peer-sync pull path is filed separately as **#3659** — a general federation fix benefiting every federated kind, not a privacy prerequisite. It is version-gated so an older peer that does not present identity degrades gracefully rather than losing sync.
* `AGENTS.md`'s Security Model previously stated that PortOS "intentionally omits authentication … HTTPS." Both exist as opt-in, off-by-default features, and the stale wording actively misleads anyone reasoning about what a peer channel can guarantee. Corrected as part of this change.

## Revisiting

Superseding this ADR requires more than "the transport got safer." It requires a concrete user need that a backup restore genuinely cannot serve, plus, at minimum: per-peer identity and category authorization on the pull path, an explicit per-category opt-in that defaults off, a hard refusal to transmit when the far end reports auth disabled, and a resolution for `masked_value` (it must not travel in plaintext). Absent all of those, the answer stays no.
