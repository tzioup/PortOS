# ADR: Tribe Relationship Graph + Universe Render-Runs Stay Machine-Local

* **Date:** 2026-06-26
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Related:** issue #1724 (folded from the #1561 full-sync gap matrix), [`server/services/tribe.js`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/server/services/tribe.js), [`server/services/universeBuilder/db.js`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/server/services/universeBuilder/db.js), [`server/services/memorySync.js`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/server/services/memorySync.js), [`docs/STORAGE.md`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/docs/STORAGE.md).

## Context

Epic #1561 ("full-sync federated node pairs") audited every data domain for whether it mirrors across a federated peer pair. Two `db-primary` PostgreSQL domains were left undecided and folded into #1724 for a sync-vs-local call:

1. **Tribe / relationship graph** — `tribe_people`, `tribe_touchpoints`, `tribe_memory_links`. Not in `PEER_SUBSCRIBABLE_KINDS` (`server/services/sharing/peerSync.js`) and not a `dataSync` snapshot category. Local-only today.
2. **Universe render-runs** — `universe_runs` (one row per render, capped at 200 globally). Read through Postgres by `dataSync` when it loads universes, but the run rows themselves are never included in any snapshot or push.

The acceptance criterion is a documented decision for each, with anything that stays local recorded in the #1561 gap matrix as intentionally-excluded.

## Decision

**Both stay machine-local. Neither is federated.**

### Tribe graph — local, by precedent

PortOS already federates memory _nodes_ (`memories`, via the `sync_sequence` pull-cursor in `server/services/memorySync.js`) but **deliberately keeps the relationship graph between them instance-local**. memorySync.js states it plainly:

> memory\_links (relationships) are not synced — only the memories table is replicated. Relationship data is instance-local.

The Tribe graph is the same shape — a personal relationship/CRM graph — and is structurally coupled to two domains PortOS holds machine-local on purpose:

* **`tribe_memory_links`** is a relationship layer over `memories`, directly analogous to the `memory_links` table that is already, by design, not federated. Syncing tribe's memory cross-links while the brain's own `memory_links` stay local would be internally inconsistent.
* **`tribe_touchpoints`** carry `calendar_account_id` / `calendar_event_id` pointing at a per-machine connected-calendar OAuth integration. Those refs do not resolve on a peer that has a different (or no) calendar connection, so a touchpoint synced verbatim would carry dangling, machine-specific provenance.

Federating people + touchpoints while silently dropping the memory links and calendar refs would produce a lossy, incoherent partial mirror; federating them faithfully would first require federating the calendar-account integration layer, which is inherently machine-local. Keeping the whole Tribe graph local is consistent with the established "relationship data is instance-local" boundary.

### Universe render-runs — local, regenerable cache

`universe_runs` is a **regenerable render-output cache**, not durable source data. The durable source — the universe record itself — already federates via the `dataSync` snapshot/push model, so a peer reconstructs its own run history by rendering. Two properties make federation actively wrong rather than merely unnecessary:

* The cap is **200 rows globally** (newest-across-all-universes, trimmed inside `appendRun`), not per-universe. Two peers each generating runs would continuously evict each other's rows to honor one shared cap — churn with no durable value.
* Runs are append-only outputs of a deterministic-enough render step; there is nothing in a run a peer cannot reproduce locally on demand.

This matches the existing classification in `docs/STORAGE.md`, which already describes `universe_runs` as "local-only, capped 200, never federated."

## Consequences

* No new `PEER_SUBSCRIBABLE_KINDS` entries, no `dataSync` categories, and no new `PORTOS_SCHEMA_VERSIONS` keys — so none of the schema-version coverage guards (peerSync `RECORD_KIND_SCHEMA_CATEGORIES`, dataSync, `schemaVersions`) are touched.
* The decision is pinned by a guard test — the "keeps the Tribe graph + universe render-runs intentionally OUT of the sync graph" case in `server/services/sharing/peerSync.test.js` (alongside the other gate-map completeness guards) — asserting `tribe_*` and `universe_runs` are absent from the sync graph. Federating either later is a conscious act: update that test and this ADR alongside the wiring.
* If the brain `memory_links` relationship graph and the calendar-account layer are ever federated, revisit Tribe — at that point the coupling argument no longer holds and people + touchpoints could mirror cleanly.

## Alternatives considered

* **Federate the Tribe graph now (mirror the authors/artists record-kind pattern).** Rejected: it crosses the deliberate "relationship data is instance-local" boundary, and the memory-link + calendar-ref coupling makes a faithful mirror impossible without first federating two other machine-local layers.
* **Federate `universe_runs` as append/LWW with the 200-cap honored on the receiver.** Rejected: a global cap shared by two independent producers guarantees mutual eviction churn, and the data is regenerable, so the mirror buys nothing the universe-record sync doesn't already provide.
