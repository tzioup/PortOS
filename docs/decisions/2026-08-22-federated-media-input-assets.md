# ADR: Conditioning Crosses to an Allowlisted Peer; Weights and Chain State Do Not

* **Date:** 2026-08-22
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Supersedes (in part):** the "Local input assets are out of scope, and stay out" section and rule 2's closing sentence of ADR [federated visual prompts](2026-08-20-federated-visual-prompts.md), which named both as decisions to be revisited by a later ADR. Rules 1, 3, 4 and 5 of that ADR are unchanged and still govern.
* **Related:** epic #4348 (federated media providers), [`server/lib/federatedMediaWire.js`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/server/lib/federatedMediaWire.js), [`server/lib/validation.js`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/server/lib/validation.js), [`docs/FEDERATED_MEDIA_PROVIDERS.md`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/docs/FEDERATED_MEDIA_PROVIDERS.md), ADR [privacy records machine-local](2026-08-08-privacy-records-machine-local.md) (#2148).

## Context

Federated media rendering shipped text-to-image, text-to-video and instrumental text-to-audio. Four items were deliberately left undecided rather than unimplemented, and each one has been re-raised by a later review because there was no record saying which way it went:

1. **Input-asset transfer.** An init image, a reference image or a start/end video frame is refused with `400 MEDIA_PROVIDER_INPUT_UNSUPPORTED`. That makes every image-to-image, reference-conditioned and keyframed render local-only, which is exactly the work a user offloads to the GPU peer.
2. **Remote lyrical conditioning.** A federated audio submission is instrumental only. The flagship federatable audio model (MiniMax Music 3) is a _lyrical_ model, so the one thing worth sending it is the one thing the wire refuses.
3. **Multi-provider fairness / failover.**
4. **A fixed-vocabulary "visual profile"** as a privacy-preserving substitute for a free-form image/video prompt.

The prior ADR settled the general shape — a _submission body_ may carry what the work is; a _status payload_ may carry nothing — but explicitly reserved (1) and (2) for a new ADR, because both widen what a submission body contains rather than merely restating rule 1. This ADR decides all four.

## Decision

**Conditioning is part of the submission, and crosses under the same gate as the prompt. Model weights and multi-step chain state are not conditioning, and do not cross at all.**

### 1. Conditioning images cross as uploaded assets

An init image, reference images, and a video start/end frame are what the render is _of_. Rule 1 of the prior ADR already answered the general question for prompts — "a peer that cannot read the prompt cannot do the work at all" — and an image-to-image render is the same argument with a denser payload: a peer that cannot read the init image cannot perform an image-to-image render, so "render this remotely" and "the source image stays home" are mutually exclusive for that mode, exactly as they were for the prompt.

The denser payload does change the _mechanism_, not the _authorization_:

* Bytes travel through a dedicated, authenticated provider endpoint (`POST /api/federation/media/v1/assets`), never inline in a job body and never as a filesystem path. The upload declares its SHA-256 and the provider verifies it before storing, so a truncated or altered transfer fails rather than rendering something subtly different.
* The provider stores an uploaded asset **caller-scoped**, keyed by content hash, in a staging area outside every user-facing media root, with a bounded TTL and an explicit size and MIME allowlist. Re-uploading identical bytes is idempotent, which is what makes a reconcile after a restart free rather than a second multi-megabyte transfer.
* A provider advertises whether it accepts input assets at all, and with what limits, on its capability projection. **Absent reads as unknown, never as supported** — an older provider that has never heard of the field keeps refusing conditioning, and a consumer that cannot see the field refuses to send it. That is the same fail-closed rule the queue-capacity fields already follow.
* Every existing gate still applies unchanged: the peer must be registered, enabled, enabled as a media provider, allowlisted for this exact kind/engine/model, authenticated with a verified Basic credential, and — for a standing unattended route — recognized as a tailnet host (rule 5 of the prior ADR). Conditioning does not get its own weaker path.

### 2. Lyrics cross; the instrumental style prompt still does not

Rule 2 of the prior ADR required a privacy-safe canonical form _where one is available at no expressive cost_, and closed by noting that remote lyrical conditioning stayed unsolved. It is not unsolved so much as mis-framed: the qualifier was doing all the work, and lyrics fail it.

A style/mood/instrument profile renders an instrumental prompt with no expressive loss, so the fixed-vocabulary requirement stays exactly as it is for `prompt`. **Lyrics have no such form.** Lyrics _are_ the words; there is no alphabet that encodes them without discarding them, which is the same reason the prior ADR rejected a fixed vocabulary for visual prompts. So lyrics cross verbatim under rule 1's logic, bounded by length and gated on the provider capability already advertising `lyrics: true` for the selected model.

The consequence for persisted state is deliberate and is called out here because it reverses an earlier comment: the remote audio marker now stores the lyrics it will submit, exactly as the image and video markers already store their prompts. Keeping them out was what made a routed audio job unable to carry the conditioning it was routed to produce.

### 3. Model weights do not cross

A LoRA is not conditioning — it is a model. The issue that opened this work lists **remote model installation and automatic model downloads under Out of scope**, and nothing here changes that: a provider renders with the models its operator installed and allowlisted, and a consumer selects from that advertisement. A per-job weight upload would be a model-distribution channel wearing a conditioning costume — unbounded in size, persistent in effect on the provider, and outside the capability contract that makes provider selection honest.

A federated request naming LoRA weights therefore keeps failing closed with `MEDIA_PROVIDER_INPUT_UNSUPPORTED`, naming the weights as the reason. The supported path for a user who wants remote LoRA rendering is to install the LoRA on the provider and allowlist a model that uses it.

### 4. Multi-step chain state does not cross

A source video to extend, chained chunks, and IC-LoRA video references are not single-render conditioning: they are the state of a multi-step pipeline whose steps the consumer sequences. Sending them would make the provider a partial owner of a chain it cannot see the rest of, and it re-opens the failover question in the middle of a sequence. These stay local, refused with the same typed code.

### 5. Multi-provider fairness and failover: won't-do

Declined, not deferred. Automatic load balancing is listed under **Out of scope** on issue #4348, and automatic failover directly contradicts the fail-closed routing decision taken in #4679: a job that silently re-targets a different peer on failure has changed both _where the user's data went_ and _which model produced the result_, without anyone seeing it happen. Both are exactly the outcomes the explicit-selection contract exists to prevent.

If a future need for this appears, it needs a decision about routing policy and idempotent re-submission first, and its own ADR — reopening it as an implementation detail is what this entry exists to prevent.

### 6. A fixed-vocabulary visual profile: won't-do

Declined. The prior ADR already rejected it under Alternatives considered — "any enum small enough to be privacy-safe cannot express what the user asked for… it would not protect the prompt so much as discard it." It is recorded here only because it kept resurfacing as an open item on #4348 after that ADR settled it.

## Alternatives considered

* **Inline the asset in the job body as base64.** Rejected: it inflates the payload by a third, forces the whole conditioning set through the JSON body size limit, and makes an idempotent replay after a restart re-send every byte. A separate content-addressed endpoint gets deduplication and integrity checking for free.
* **Let the provider fetch the asset from the consumer by URL.** Rejected: it inverts the connection direction the federation transport is built around (the consumer holds the peer credential and initiates every hop), and it would require the consumer to expose an unauthenticated or separately-credentialed asset surface to a peer. Push, authenticated by the same credential as every other hop, adds no new inbound attack surface.
* **Keep refusing conditioning and tell users to render locally.** Rejected: it is the status quo, and it removes remote rendering from precisely the workloads where offloading matters most. The peer is allowlisted for this work because it is trusted with it — a reference image is denser than a prompt, but it is the same trust boundary and the same machine.
* **Strip or downscale the asset before sending.** Rejected for the same reason the prior ADR rejected redacting names from prompts: it makes the render silently wrong. A conditioning image that arrives altered produces a plausible render of something the user did not ask for.
* **Allow lyrics only when the consumer confirms per render.** Rejected as security theater on top of a decision already made locally: enabling a peer as a media provider and allowlisting a lyrical model for it _is_ the consent, and a second prompt on every render trains the user to click through it.

## Consequences

* The wire stays **version 1**. Every field this decision adds is optional in both directions, and absence reads as _unsupported_, so an older provider and a newer consumer (and the reverse) both degrade to the pre-existing text-only behavior instead of failing. No `SCHEMA_VERSIONS` bump is warranted: no record kind, sync category, or federated record shape changes.
* Rule 3 of the prior ADR is untouched and its guard still holds: status and capability payloads carry counts, readiness and limits — never a prompt, never lyrics, and never an asset, a filename, or a hash derived from one. The capability's input-asset block is limits only.
* A provider now accepts inbound bytes, which it did not before. The staging area is caller-scoped, size-capped, MIME-allowlisted, content-hash-verified, TTL-swept, excluded from backups, and outside every media root the gallery or the sync layer reads — so an uploaded asset can never be mistaken for local user content or federated onward as a record.
* "Is this conditioning, a model, or chain state?" is the question any future federated input must answer. The three answers above are the precedent, and the second and third are refusals rather than gaps — a reviewer finding `MEDIA_PROVIDER_INPUT_UNSUPPORTED` on a LoRA is looking at a decision, not a to-do.

## Revisiting

Rules 3 and 4 are refusals with stated reasons; changing either needs a new ADR naming what changed about the reason. Rule 1's mechanism may be extended to further conditioning _kinds_ under the same gate without a new ADR, provided the new kind is single-render conditioning rather than a model or chain state, and provided it keeps the capability-gated, hash-verified, caller-scoped, TTL-bounded transfer described above.
