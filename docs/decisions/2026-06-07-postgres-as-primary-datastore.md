# ADR: PostgreSQL as the Primary Datastore (Multi-Model)

* **Date:** 2026-06-07
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Supersedes:** the implicit "JSON files in `./data/` are primary" assumption that held through early development.
* **Related:** [`docs/STORAGE.md`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/docs/STORAGE.md) (storage-classification contract), [`docs/plans/2026-06-06-create-postgres-storage-inventory.md`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/docs/plans/2026-06-06-create-postgres-storage-inventory.md) (inventory + phase roadmap), [`docs/plans/2026-06-07-create-relational-schema-design.md`](https://github.com/tzioup/PortOS/tree/main/docs/plans/2026-06-07-create-relational-schema-design.md) (Create-domain schema design).

## Context

PortOS is single-user, self-hosted, runs on a private Tailscale network, and is **distributed to many independent installs** — a single user commonly federates several of their own machines as sync peers. Two needs pushed past what flat JSON files can serve:

1. **Semantic search over embeddings.** Memory and the creative Catalog need vector similarity at query time. Loading every JSON record into memory to scan doesn't scale, and a separate vector database (Pinecone/Qdrant/Chroma) would be a second stateful dependency to provision, back up, and keep transactionally consistent with the source records on every self-hosted install.
2. **Rich connections between elements** across Universe, Series, Catalog, and the Create domains — connections we want to query and report on, not just store.

The monolithic single-file JSON stores were also already cracking under write contention (`media-jobs.json`, `video-history.json`), and `collectionStore` — the per-record-directory pattern — was itself the "we outgrew one big JSON" patch.

## Decision

Use **PostgreSQL as the primary datastore, as a&#x20;**_**multi-model**_**&#x20;engine** — not as a classically normalized relational schema. Concretely:

* **JSONB document bodies.** Each app-native record (Universe, Series, Issue, etc.) is one row whose full payload lives in a `JSONB data` column. The existing sanitizers stay the single source of truth for record shape. Nested structures (seasons, stages, covers) stay in the JSONB — no decomposition into child tables.
* **Promoted columns** for the handful of fields the service queries/sorts/filters on (`name`, `status`, `schema_version`, `ephemeral`, `updated_at`, `deleted`, `deleted_at`) — mirrored from the record body on write, indexed for cheap scans.
* **pgvector** (768-dim, HNSW + `vector_cosine_ops`) co-located with the data for embedding search, fused with BM25 full-text (`tsvector`) via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. One engine, one backup unit, transactionally consistent with the records.
* **Connections via soft refs + catalog edge tables.** No hard foreign keys. Cross-domain links are `TEXT` refs resolved at the app layer (`catalog_ingredient_refs`); ingredient-to-ingredient edges live in `catalog_ingredient_relations`. Integrity is delivered by resolver queries and dangling-ref reports, not DB constraints — because in a federated install, a ref can legitimately arrive before its target, and targets can be soft-deleted.
* **Binary assets stay on the filesystem**, indexed in the DB (`asset-file-db-indexed`). The DB points to files; it does not absorb the bytes (per `STORAGE.md`).

## Alternatives Considered

* **Keep everything in JSON files (status quo).** Rejected: no indexed or vector search, no transactional multi-record writes, and monolithic-file write contention was already a problem. Files remain correct only for binary asset bytes, externally-synced bodies (iCloud/Git/hand-edited), and ephemeral state.
* **A NoSQL / document database (Mongo, Couch).** Rejected: it would preserve the JSONB-blob ergonomics we already get from Postgres, but **lose** pgvector, native full-text search, recursive-CTE graph traversal over the catalog edges, and transactional multi-table writes — while _still_ adding an external stateful dependency that is no lighter to operate. The only NoSQL upside is horizontal write-scaling across nodes, which a single-user app will never need.

## Consequences

**Positive**

* One stateful service to run and back up; embeddings, documents, full-text, and the connection graph all live together and stay consistent.
* The Catalog becomes the **Create graph hub** (roadmap Phase 4): every cross-domain connection is expressed as one catalog relation/ref instead of FKs scattered across a dozen tables — one graph to query.
* Federation stays **storage-invisible**: the snapshot/push + last-writer-wins model is unchanged, the wire payload is identical whether the sender is file- or DB-backed, and no `PORTOS_SCHEMA_VERSIONS` bump is required for the storage swap.

**Costs / risks to manage** (tracked as GitHub issues)

* **Postgres is now a load-bearing install dependency** for normal installs and for every federated peer machine. The `MEMORY_BACKEND=file` path must be explicitly classified as supported-or-test-only and the setup/docker path must be bulletproof.
* **There is no versioned DB-migration runner yet** — schema evolves through idempotent `ensureSchema()` `CREATE IF NOT EXISTS` gates plus a parity test against `init-db.sql`. That covers additive changes only; column renames, type changes, and row transforms (including an embedding-dimensionality change away from the hardcoded `vector(768)`) need a real runner before the schema grows further.
* **The federation `mutationEpoch` patch is a seam.** Moving universes to the DB broke dataSync's directory-mtime fingerprint, patched with a module-level epoch counter. As each further domain migrates, this should collapse into a single change-token abstraction rather than N ad-hoc counters.

## Scale Note

Data **volume** is not the concern — tens of universes, hundreds of issues, low-thousands of catalog rows, single-digit MB of JSONB. Postgres is idle at this size for the lifetime of a single-user install. The scalability that matters here is **capability** (search, connections, integrity reporting), which is exactly what this decision buys and what flat files could not provide.
