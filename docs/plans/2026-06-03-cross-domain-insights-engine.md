# Cross-Domain Insights Engine (M42 P5)

Design spike for connecting genome ↔ health ↔ taste ↔ identity ↔ creative output into narrative insights surfaced in Brain. Resolves the four design questions from issue #738 against the **actual** PortOS codebase and lays out a phased plan a future `/claim` can pick up.

## Status: partially shipped, design not yet written

This milestone has been built incrementally as ad-hoc `INS-XX` tasks **without a unifying design**, which is exactly the gap this spike closes. What exists today:

| Piece                                                      | Status                                    | Where                                                                                        |

| REST routes                                                | shipped                                   | `server/routes/insights.js`, validation `insightRefreshSchema` in `server/lib/validation.js` |

| **INS-03 Health ↔ goals**                                  | **missing**                               | —                                                                                            |
| **Insight disposition (dismiss / accept) data model + UX** | **missing**                               | —                                                                                            |
| **Structured "facts table" the LLM consumes**              | **missing** (prompts hand-roll free text) | —                                                                                            |
| **Brain digest integration**                               | **missing**                               | —                                                                                            |

So the engine _renders_ three independently-generated analyses, but it has no concept of a **discrete, dismissable, accept-able insight**, no health↔goals pairing, and no structured contract feeding the LLM. The sections below specify those four missing pieces and the model that unifies them.

***

## Q1 — Which signal pairs to correlate first

**Decision: ship the four pairs below, in this order.** Each pairing is justified by (a) the data already existing in PortOS, (b) a non-trivial correlation worth surfacing, and (c) the user being able to _act_ on it.

| # | Pair                                    | Source services                                                                                                                                              | Why first                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Method                                                                                        |
| - | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Genome ↔ Health (blood)**             | `genome.js` `getGenomeSummary()`, `meatspaceHealth.js` `getBloodTests()`                                                                                     | Already shipped (INS-01); highest-confidence because both sides are objective lab data. The `CATEGORY_BLOOD_MAP` (cardiovascular, iron, methylation, diabetes, thyroid, nutrient) already aligns curated markers to analytes. | Rule-based, no LLM — deterministic and auditable.                                             |
| 2 | **Taste ↔ Creative output**             | `taste-questionnaire.js` `getTasteProfile()`, Creative Catalog (`catalogDB.js`) + Universe/Series/Writers-Room records                                       | The whole point of taste profiling is to inform creative production; this closes the loop the digital-twin doc describes. Stated aesthetic preferences vs. what the user actually _makes_.                                    | LLM — qualitative theme extraction (extends INS-02 beyond identity into produced work).       |
| 3 | **Health ↔ Goals** (the missing INS-03) | `meatspaceHealth.js` (workouts, body history, blood pressure, blood panels), `identity/goals.js` `getGoals()` + `goalProgress.js` `getGoalProgressSummary()` | Goals frequently _are_ health goals (weight, fitness, longevity); pairing measured biometrics against stated goal progress is the most directly actionable insight surface.                                                   | Hybrid — rule-based progress deltas feed an LLM "are you on track / what's drifting" summary. |
| 4 | **Genome ↔ Longevity**                  | `genome.js` (the `longevity` marker category already exists: FOXO3A et al. in `curatedGenomeMarkers.js`), `meatspaceHealth.js` epigenetic tests              | Longevity is a named GOALS.md ambition and the genome data is already categorized. Pairs protective/risk longevity variants with epigenetic-age measurements.                                                                 | Rule-based correlation + LLM narrative framing.                                               |

**Explicitly deferred** (data too sparse or correlation too weak to be honest right now): genome↔taste, calendar↔health (sleep/activity timing), messages-tone↔personality. These re-enter the queue once their source data has more density.

**Polarity / honesty rule (carry forward from INS-01):** every correlation must keep the `inferMarkerPolarity` + `confidenceForStatus` discipline already in `insightsService.js` — surface _patterns and correlations_, never causal/medical claims. New pairs reuse the same `confidence: { level, color, label, polarity }` shape so the UI badge (`ConfidenceBadge.jsx`) stays uniform.

***

## Q2 — Where insights land

**Decision: keep the dedicated `/insights` surface as the home, AND feed a curated slice into the Brain daily digest. Not either/or — a hub + a spoke.**

Rationale:

* The `/insights` page already exists, is nav-registered, and is the right home for the _exploratory_ view (browse all correlations by domain, refresh on demand). Folding everything into the digest would bury the rich per-domain tabs.
* But an insight the user never opens the page to see is worthless. The Brain **daily digest** (`brain.js` `runDailyDigest()`) is the existing once-a-day "here's what's relevant" surface and is the natural push channel. It already gathers projects/admin/ people/inbox and emits a ≤150-word `digestText` via the `brain-daily-digest` prompt.

**Integration shape:**

1. The insights engine maintains a queue of **undismissed, high-confidence insights** (see Q3 data model).
2. `runDailyDigest()` pulls the top 1–2 _fresh_ (generated since last digest) insights and passes them as an additional `pendingInsights` context key to the digest prompt, which references them in one sentence with a deep-link to `/insights/<tab>`.
3. The **weekly review** (`runWeeklyReview()`) gets the fuller treatment: a dedicated "Patterns this week" section listing newly-surfaced insights, since weekly is the natural cadence for slower-moving genome/health/taste signals.

This respects the "single source of truth" principle: insights are _generated and stored_ by `insightsService`, and Brain digest is a _reader_ — it never re-derives them.

***

## Q3 — How the user dismisses / accepts an insight

This is the **largest missing piece**. Today an "insight" is just cached LLM text with no per-item identity, so there's nothing to accept or dismiss. The design introduces a first-class **Insight record**.

### Data model

Insights become discrete records, persisted under `data/insights/` (the dir `insightsService.js` already targets). Because insights are per-record, frequently mutated (disposition flips), and want independent reads, use `createCollectionStore` from `server/lib/collectionStore.js` (the same pattern migration 034 used for `universeBuilder`) → `data/insights/{id}/index.json` with a type-level `data/insights/index.json` stamping `schemaVersion`.

```jsonc
{
  "id": "ins_2026-06-03_genome-health_HFE",   // stable, deterministic where possible
  "pair": "genome-health",                     // one of the Q1 pairs
  "title": "Iron-overload carrier + elevated ferritin",
  "narrative": "Your HFE carrier status pairs with ferritin trending high over your last two panels…",
  "confidence": { "level": "weak", "color": "orange", "label": "Carrier", "polarity": "risk" },
  "facts": [ /* the structured rows that produced this — see Q4 */ ],
  "sources": [                                  // mirrors the Ask Source shape (see Q4)
    { "kind": "genome", "id": "genome:rs1800562", "title": "HFE rs1800562", "href": "/meatspace/genome" },
    { "kind": "blood",  "id": "blood:ferritin",   "title": "Ferritin (latest)", "href": "/meatspace/blood" }
  ],
  "disposition": "new",        // "new" | "accepted" | "dismissed" | "snoozed"
  "dispositionAt": null,
  "dismissReason": null,       // optional free text when dismissed
  "snoozeUntil": null,         // ISO date when "snoozed"
  "generatedAt": "2026-06-03T…",
  "generator": "rule" ,        // "rule" | "llm"
  "ai": { "providerId": "…", "modelId": "…" }  // present only when generator === "llm"
}
```

### Disposition semantics (use a sentinel, per CLAUDE.md)

* `new` — surfaced, not yet triaged. Eligible for the daily/weekly digest push.
* `accepted` — user marked it meaningful/true. Stays pinned at the top of its tab; **excluded from re-generation churn** (a regenerate must _preserve_ an accepted insight's id + disposition rather than overwrite it — mirror the LLM-merge "absent vs intentionally empty" rule: a regenerated batch that no longer contains an accepted insight does NOT delete it, it marks it `stale: true`).
* `dismissed` — user rejected it (wrong, irrelevant, or already known). Hidden from the page and **never re-surfaced**: regeneration checks a dismissed-fingerprint set (`pair` + a content hash of the underlying facts) so the same correlation doesn't bounce back next refresh.
* `snoozed` — hide until `snoozeUntil`, then revert to `new`. (Resolves the "true but not now" case.)

### UX

Reuse the existing tab components; add a disposition control to `InsightCard.jsx`. Per the user's confirmation-UX preference (no two-click-arm patterns), the controls are **direct inline actions**, not armed confirmations:

* **Accept** (check) — one click, optimistic; pins the card with an "Accepted" chip.
* **Dismiss** (×) — one click, optimistic; the card collapses to a thin "Dismissed — undo" row for the rest of the session (undo restores `new`), then disappears on reload.
* **Snooze** (clock) — opens a tiny inline picker (1w / 1mo / custom), no modal.

Optimistic updates follow the **reactive-UI rule**: mutate local card state immediately, PATCH in the background, roll back on error. A small reusable `useInsightDisposition` hook (in `client/src/hooks/`, barrel + README per the maintenance rule) wraps the optimistic PATCH, analogous to the existing `useLockToggle`.

### Routes (new)

```
GET    /api/insights              — list insight records (filter by ?pair= &disposition=)
POST   /api/insights/generate     — (re)run generation for a pair; preserves accepted, skips dismissed
PATCH  /api/insights/:id          — { disposition, dismissReason?, snoozeUntil? }
```

Validation extends `server/lib/validation.js`: a new `insightDispositionSchema` (`z.enum(['new','accepted','dismissed','snoozed'])` + optional reason/snoozeUntil) wired into the PATCH, and a `insightGenerateSchema` (`{ pair, providerId?, model? }`). The existing `insightRefreshSchema` stays for the legacy narrative/themes refresh endpoints during the transition.

***

## Q4 — Structured "facts table" vs. raw stage data

**Decision: the LLM receives a structured facts table, NOT raw stage data.** The current implementation hand-rolls free-text context blocks inline in each prompt (`refreshCrossDomainNarrative` concatenates `GENOME HEALTH MARKERS:\n…` strings). That is brittle, untestable, and re-derives the same shaping logic per call. We formalize it.

### Why a facts table

1. **Determinism & testability** — a pure `buildFactsTable(pair)` function is unit-testable without an LLM in the loop; the prompt becomes a thin render of validated rows.
2. **Provenance for free** — each fact already carries its source, so the resulting insight's `sources[]` (the Ask-style chips) fall out of the same structure rather than being reconstructed.
3. **Token discipline** — raw stage records (full blood panels, every taste answer, complete genome summary) blow the budget; the facts table is the pre-filtered, pre-normalized slice that actually matters for a given pair.

### Schema sketch

A `Fact` row is the atomic unit feeding generation. It deliberately mirrors the **Ask `Source` shape** (`{ kind, id, title, snippet, relevance, href, meta }` in `server/services/askService.js`) so the source-chip rendering and provenance contract are shared across Ask and Insights rather than diverging.

```jsonc
// Fact (one row of the facts table)
{
  "domain": "genome",          // genome | blood | apple-health | taste | goals | creative | longevity
  "key": "rs1800562",          // stable identifier within the domain
  "label": "HFE C282Y",        // human-readable
  "value": "heterozygous",     // normalized value (string | number)
  "unit": null,                // e.g. "ng/mL" for analytes
  "observedAt": "2026-05-01",  // when this datum is from (latest blood draw, etc.)
  "polarity": "risk",          // reuse INS-01 polarity where applicable
  "source": {                  // === Ask Source shape — shared provenance contract
    "kind": "genome",
    "id": "genome:rs1800562",
    "title": "HFE rs1800562",
    "href": "/meatspace/genome"
  }
}
```

```jsonc
// FactsTable (what one pair's generator assembles and hands the LLM)
{
  "pair": "health-goals",
  "facts": [ /* Fact[] — already filtered & normalized for this pair */ ],
  "generatedAt": "2026-06-03T…"
}
```

### Prompt contract

The LLM prompt renders the facts table as a compact, labeled table (not prose blocks) and is instructed to return **structured insights** (a JSON array of `{ title, narrative, confidence, factKeys[], strength }`) — where `factKeys[]` references the rows that justify each insight, so the engine can attach the exact `sources[]` and `facts[]` to the stored Insight record without the LLM having to re-emit provenance. This also lets the UI show "based on: HFE, ferritin" deterministically.

Rule-based pairs (genome↔health, genome↔longevity progress deltas) skip the LLM entirely and synthesize the Insight record directly from the facts table — same record shape, `generator: "rule"`.

***

## Phased implementation plan

A future `/claim` can pick these up in order. Each phase is independently shippable.

### Phase A — Facts-table foundation (refactor, no user-visible change)

* Add `server/services/insights/factsTable.js` with `buildFactsTable(pair)` and the `Fact`/`FactsTable` shapes above. One builder per pair (genome-health builder lifts the existing `getLatestBloodValues` + `CATEGORY_BLOOD_MAP` logic out of `insightsService.js`).
* Add `insightsFacts.test.js` covering each builder with fixture data.
* Re-point `refreshCrossDomainNarrative` / `generateThemeAnalysis` to render from facts tables instead of hand-rolled context strings (behavior-preserving).
* Barrel + README rows for any new `server/lib` helper.

### Phase B — Insight records + disposition (the core missing model)

* Stand up the `createCollectionStore` for insights → `data/insights/{id}/index.json`; seed `data.reference/insights/` and add a migration in `scripts/migrations/` that converts the legacy `themes.json` / `narrative.json` caches into discrete records (per the distribution-model rule — other installs have those files).
* Add `GET /api/insights`, `POST /api/insights/generate`, `PATCH /api/insights/:id` with `insightDispositionSchema` + `insightGenerateSchema` validation.
* Regeneration logic: preserve `accepted`, mark vanished-accepted `stale`, skip `dismissed` fingerprints, revert expired `snoozed` → `new`.

### Phase C — Disposition UX

* `useInsightDisposition` hook (optimistic PATCH, rollback on error) + barrel/README.
* Add inline Accept / Dismiss / Snooze controls to `InsightCard.jsx` (direct actions, no armed confirmation).
* Update the three tab components to render records from `GET /api/insights` and to pin accepted / hide dismissed.

### Phase D — Health ↔ Goals pair (the missing INS-03)

* `factsTable.js` builder pairing `meatspaceHealth` biometrics + `server/services/goalProgress.js` (`getGoalProgressSummary`) deltas against `server/services/identity/goals.js` goals.
* Hybrid generator: rule-based progress deltas → LLM "on track / drifting" narrative.
* New tab or fold into Cross-Domain tab (decide at impl time based on volume).

### Phase E — Brain digest integration

* `runDailyDigest()` reads top 1–2 fresh `new` insights, passes `pendingInsights` to the `brain-daily-digest` prompt (prompt-version bump + `PREVIOUS_DEFAULT_PROMPTS` entry per CLAUDE.md, since this changes a shipped prompt's default).
* `runWeeklyReview()` gets a "Patterns this week" section.

### Phase F — Genome ↔ Longevity + Taste ↔ Creative-output pairs

* Two more facts-table builders + generators, reusing everything above.

## Cross-cutting requirements (carry into every phase)

* **No causal/medical claims** — keep the INS-01 polarity/confidence discipline.
* **Distribution model** — `themes.json`/`narrative.json` exist on other installs; any storage change needs a migration + seed in `data.reference/`.
* **Sentinel discipline** — `disposition` is an explicit enum; never let "no insights yet" collapse into "generation failed" (mirror the `available:false, reason` pattern already in `insightsService.js`).
* **Shared provenance** — `Fact.source` and `Insight.sources` reuse the Ask `Source` shape so source chips render identically across `/ask` and `/insights`.
* **Reactive + optimistic UI** — disposition changes mutate local state first, PATCH in the background.
