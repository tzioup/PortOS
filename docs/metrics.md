# The `METRICS.md` convention

`METRICS.md` is a repo-root file a **managed app** adds to document its own
success metrics — how the app measures whether it is doing its job — so that
agents can evaluate the app against its own goals and purpose instead of guessing.

It is the app-performance counterpart to `GOALS.md`: `GOALS.md` says *what the app
is trying to achieve*; `METRICS.md` says *how you know whether it's achieving it,
and where those numbers live*.

## Why it exists

PortOS's [Layered Intelligence loop](./plans/2026-07-07-layered-intelligence-loop.md)
perpetually reviews each managed app and files at most one high-value improvement
proposal per run. To reason well it needs to evaluate the app against **its own**
performance — user success, product KPIs, production telemetry — not against how
reliably PortOS's coding agents happen to change it.

Most of that data lives outside the repo: a production database, an external
telemetry/analytics service, a metrics dashboard, an events pipeline. An agent has
no way to discover those unless the repo tells it where they are and how to read
them. `METRICS.md` is that map.

## Layered Intelligence decision contract

Layered Intelligence uses a metrics-first decision path:

1. When a metric shows a meaningful gap, it proposes the single highest-value
   app change that can plausibly move that metric.
2. When the metrics are missing, unavailable, stale, or inconclusive, its
   reasoning agent may inspect the repository read-only to understand the
   relevant product flow and existing instrumentation. This is context discovery,
   not permission to turn the run into a generic code-quality audit.
3. When that inspection identifies a specific missing signal or context that
   blocks evaluation against a named goal, it files an `app-data-gap` issue for
   the minimum visibility needed. The issue must identify the unanswered product
   question, the expected data source, and acceptance criteria; “add more
   telemetry” is not decision-complete.
4. It files nothing only when the available evidence is sufficient and healthy,
   the needed visibility already exists, or no decision-complete proposal fits
   the configured scopes (subject to the loop's filing safety and delivery
   gates). Inconclusive metrics alone do not prove the app is healthy.

The reasoning agent never edits code in this task. A deterministic output hook
validates and deduplicates its structured proposal before filing it to the app's
configured tracker.

## Who reads it

- **Layered Intelligence** gathers repo-root `METRICS.md` as the `appMetrics`
  source (on by default for every app) and folds it into the reasoning prompt.
  When an app has no `METRICS.md`, the loop is nudged to propose adding one as an
  `app-data-gap` — so the app becomes measurable over time.
- **Coding agents** picking up a filed proposal can follow the same doc to fetch
  current numbers before/after a change and judge whether it moved the metric.
- **Humans** get a single, honest description of what "healthy" means for the app.

## What to put in it

Keep it concise and specific. A good `METRICS.md` answers:

1. **What does success mean for this app?** The 3–7 metrics that actually matter,
   each tied back to a goal in `GOALS.md`.
2. **Where does each metric live?** Production database, telemetry service,
   dashboard, or log/event source — named by role, with a non-secret locator.
3. **How does an agent read the current value?** A query, an endpoint, or a CLI
   command it can run — parameterized by environment variables, never with
   embedded credentials.
4. **What's a good/bad value?** A target, threshold, or recent baseline so a
   reader can tell whether the number is healthy.

### Suggested shape

```markdown
# Metrics — example-app

How we measure whether example-app is succeeding. See GOALS.md for the goals
these metrics serve.

## Key metrics

| Metric | Why it matters (goal) | Source | Target |
|--------|-----------------------|--------|--------|
| Weekly active users | Reach — "help more people do X" | production DB | ↑ week over week |
| Task completion rate | Core value — users finish the flow | events pipeline | ≥ 80% |
| p95 request latency | Quality of service | telemetry service | < 400 ms |
| 7-day retention | Stickiness | production DB | ≥ 45% |

## Where the data lives

- **Production database** — read-only analytics replica. Connection string in the
  `ANALYTICS_DB_URL` environment variable (never commit it). Read-only user only.
- **Telemetry / analytics service** — dashboard at the URL in `TELEMETRY_URL`;
  API token in `TELEMETRY_TOKEN`.

## How to read current values (for agents)

Run these from the repo with the environment loaded. They print current numbers;
they do not modify anything.

- Weekly active users:
  `psql "$ANALYTICS_DB_URL" -c "select count(distinct user_id) from events where ts > now() - interval '7 days';"`
- Task completion rate: `GET $TELEMETRY_URL/api/metrics/completion-rate` with
  `Authorization: Bearer $TELEMETRY_TOKEN`.

## Notes

- All queries above hit a **read-only** replica/endpoint. Do not point them at a
  primary or run anything that writes.
```

## Rules

- **Repo-root only.** Layered Intelligence reads `METRICS.md` at the repository
  root of the app (same place it reads `GOALS.md` / `PLAN.md` / `HEALTH_REPORT.md`).
- **No secrets.** Reference credentials by environment variable or secret-manager
  key. Never paste a real connection string, password, token, or private hostname
  into the file — it is committed and shared like any other source.
- **Read-only access.** Every query or endpoint you document for agents must be a
  read-only path. An agent should be able to *observe* the metric, never mutate
  production data to measure it.
- **Keep it current.** Stale targets are worse than none — update the file when the
  metrics or their sources change.

## Feeding live numbers into the loop

`METRICS.md` documents *where* the metrics are and *how* to read them. If you also
want current values injected into each Layered Intelligence run automatically, add
a **custom source** in the app's Layered Intelligence config (Edit App →
Intelligence):

- a **command** source that runs one of the read-only queries above, or
- an **http** source that fetches a metrics endpoint.

That keeps `METRICS.md` as the human-readable map while the loop reasons over fresh
numbers each run.
