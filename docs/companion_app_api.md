# Companion-App API Contract

The stable HTTP contract a native companion client (working name **PortDeck**; repo `atomantic/PortDeck`) consumes to discover, authenticate to, and drive one or more PortOS instances across a Tailscale tailnet.

> **Scope.** This documents the **PortOS-side** contract only. The iOS app itself (Swift/SwiftUI, Keychain, iCloud store, UI) lives in its own repository per the Scope Boundary rule in `AGENTS.md` — its code, plan, and docs never land in this repo. Everything below already exists in PortOS today unless explicitly marked.

## Deployment shape the app targets

A single user commonly runs **several PortOS installs federated as sync peers** over Tailscale. Each install:

* Serves its API on **`:5555`** at the tailnet host (MagicDNS name or Tailscale IP).
* Speaks **HTTP or HTTPS** depending on whether a TLS cert is provisioned (`npm run setup:cert`). When HTTPS is on, `:5555` is TLS-only and a loopback HTTP mirror runs on `127.0.0.1:5553` (not reachable over the tailnet). See [PORTS.md](ports.md).
* Has an **optional single password** gate. When off, the tailnet-private trust model means the app needs no credential; when on, every `/api/*` request needs credentials (see [Authentication](companion_app_api.md#authentication)).

The app therefore treats each instance as `{ scheme, host, port: 5555, password? }` and must handle both the auth-on/auth-off and HTTP/HTTPS cases per instance.

## 1. Discovery & identity (pre-auth)

`GET /api/system/health` — **public**, bypasses the auth gate even when the password is on (`PUBLIC_API_PATHS` in `server/services/authGate.js`), and is the same endpoint Tailscale reachability checks hit. Use it to confirm a tailnet host is a PortOS instance and to label it on a connection screen **before** the app holds any credential.

| Field          | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `instanceId`   | Stable per-install UUID (`crypto.randomUUID()`, persisted in `data/instances.json`). The identity key the app stores per connection; survives hostname changes. `null` before the self-identity is first created.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `name`         | User-set display name for the instance (`self.name`), falling back to `hostname` when unset. This is what to show in the instance list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `hostname`     | OS hostname of the machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `authRequired` | `true` when the password gate is on — the app must obtain a password and send it on subsequent requests. `false` when off — no credential needed. Lets the app decide whether to prompt **without** a second round-trip to `/api/auth/status`. Mirrors the server's `isAuthEnabled()`; the app should still handle a `401` on a gated request as the authoritative signal to (re)prompt. |
| `scheme`       | `"http"` or `"https"` — the scheme `:5555` serves, decided once at boot. Use it to build request URLs and label the connection's security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `version`      | PortOS release the instance is running — useful for compatibility gating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

These fields are additive and non-sensitive: exposing `name`/`hostname`/ `instanceId` to tailnet peers is within the trust model. No mutation or config route is exposed pre-auth.

## 2. Authentication

PortOS auth is a single optional password (`server/services/auth.js`, `server/services/authGate.js`). The app authenticates as a **full session via HTTP Basic**, reusing the exact path peer-to-peer federation uses — nothing new to build server-side.

* **When `authRequired` is `false`:** send no credential. All `/api/*` routes are open on the tailnet.
* **When `authRequired` is `true`:** send `Authorization: Basic base64(":" + password)` on every `/api/*` request. PortOS is single-user, so the username half is ignored — only the password is verified. Store the password **per instance in the iOS Keychain**.

**CSRF note.** When auth is on, PortOS 403s cross-origin requests that carry an `Origin` header (the browser-session CSRF guard). A native `URLSession` sends **no** `Origin` header, so it passes the guard cleanly — no special handling needed. Do not set an `Origin` header manually.

A dedicated per-device API-key surface (a companion group in `apiRegistry.js` / long-lived device token) is a **possible future enhancement**, not built here — the single-password Basic posture works today and reuses the whole gate.

## 3. Instance management

Full CRUD + peer operations at `/api/instances/*` (`server/routes/instances.js`, `server/services/instances.js`). The foundation the app's instance-management UI builds on:

| Method           | Path                                         | Purpose                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`            | `/api/instances`                             | Self + all configured peers.                     |
| `GET`            | `/api/instances/self`                        | This instance's identity (`instanceId`, `name`). |
| `PUT`            | `/api/instances/self`                        | Rename this instance.                            |
| `GET`            | `/api/instances/tailnet-suffix`              | The tailnet's MagicDNS suffix.                   |
| `GET`            | `/api/instances/sync-status`                 | Federation sync status.                          |
| `POST`           | `/api/instances/peers`                       | Add a peer.                                      |
| `PUT` / `DELETE` | `/api/instances/peers/:id`                   | Update / remove a peer.                          |
| `POST`           | `/api/instances/peers/:id/connect`           | Establish a peer connection.                     |
| `POST`           | `/api/instances/peers/:id/reciprocate`       | Reciprocate a peer connection.                   |
| `POST`           | `/api/instances/peers/:id/probe`             | Probe a peer's reachability.                     |
| `POST`           | `/api/instances/peers/:id/sync`              | Trigger a sync with a peer.                      |
| `GET`            | `/api/instances/peers/:id/query?path=/api/…` | Proxy a request through a peer.                  |

## 4. Remote desktop

Remote desktop is deliberately stricter than the rest of the companion API: it requires the PortOS instance password gate to be enabled even though ordinary API routes support the default passwordless tailnet posture.

| Method | Path                           | Purpose                                                                                                           |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/api/remote-desktop/status`   | Report whether a VNC server is reachable on loopback, whether PortOS auth is enabled, and the host setup command. |
| `POST` | `/api/remote-desktop/sessions` | Create a five-minute, single-purpose viewer URL. Returns `{ viewerPath, expiresAt }`.                             |

The native client authenticates the session request with its saved instance password, then opens `viewerPath` in an embedded browser. The viewer loads the vendored noVNC module and connects to `/remote-desktop/ws?token=…`. That WebSocket is a byte-for-byte RFB bridge to `127.0.0.1:5900` (or the fixed `PORTOS_VNC_PORT` configured for the server process); neither the HTTP request nor the token can select an arbitrary TCP destination.

The separate VNC password is entered inside the viewer and is never returned to PortOS's REST API or stored by the companion. See [REMOTE\_DESKTOP.md](remote_desktop.md) for setup and the complete security contract.

## 5. Quick actions, brain capture & daily log — the palette bridge

Non-DOM voice/palette actions are dispatchable over plain HTTP via the command palette bridge (`server/routes/palette.js`) — the app drives these directly and navigates its own UI from the manifest's nav list.

* `GET /api/palette/manifest` — returns the navigable-page list (`nav`) plus the whitelisted action schemas (`actions`). DOM-driving `ui_*` tools are intentionally excluded, so the app renders its own UI and uses `nav` for routing.
* `POST /api/palette/action/:id` — dispatch a whitelisted action. Body: `{ "args": { … } }` (args object optional, defaults to `{}`). Returns `{ ok, result }`. Unknown ids 404.

Palette action ids the app is expected to use (`PALETTE_ACTIONS` in `server/routes/palette.js` — always read the live manifest for the authoritative list and each action's parameter schema):

| id                                                           | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `brain_capture`                                              | Capture a note to the Brain.             |
| `brain_search` / `brain_list_recent`                         | Search / list recent Brain entries.      |
| `daily_log_append`                                           | Append a line to today's daily log.      |
| `daily_log_read`                                             | Read today's daily log.                  |
| `goal_list` / `goal_update_progress` / `goal_log_note`       | List goals, update progress, log a note. |
| `meatspace_log_drink` / `_nicotine` / `_weight` / `_workout` | Log health events.                       |
| `meatspace_summary_today`                                    | Today's health summary.                  |

### Daily-log append (direct route)

Dictation is transcribed **on device** (or server-side over Socket.IO); the resulting text is POSTed as plain text. There is **no** server-side audio/STT upload endpoint.

* `POST /api/brain/daily-log/:date/append` — body `{ "text": "…", "source": "…" }`. `:date` accepts `today` (resolved server-side) or `YYYY-MM-DD`. Empty/whitespace `text` 400s. `source` records the **input modality** and is a controlled vocabulary — one of `text`, `voice`, or `edit` (any other value is silently normalized to `text` by `brainJournal.normalizeSource`). A dictated capture sends `"voice"`; a typed one sends `"text"`. It is **not** a free-form app-identity tag.
* `GET /api/brain/daily-log/:date` — read a day's log.

The palette `daily_log_append` / `daily_log_read` actions cover the same feature but are **not** interchangeable with these routes — pick per your need:

* `daily_log_append` (palette) always tags the entry `source: "voice"` and returns a voice-tool result shape (`{ ok, date, summary, … }`). Use it for dictated captures.
* The direct `POST …/append` route honors the `source` you send and returns `{ date, entry }`. Use it for a **typed** entry (`source: "text"`) or when you need the structured `entry` back.

## 6. MeatSpace POST training & testing

`/api/meatspace/post/*` (`server/routes/meatspacePostRoutes.js`). These are the read/write endpoints for POST config, sessions, and progress on a single instance.

> **Note — POST progress is intentionally machine-local today.** Normalized history lives in PostgreSQL `post_runs` / `post_attempts` with no peer-sync cursor or record kind; cognitive-performance history never rides federation. A companion app that shows multiple instances must read each instance's `/api/meatspace/post/*` directly.

| Method        | Path                                  | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET` / `PUT` | `/api/meatspace/post/config`          | Read / update POST config.                                     |
| `GET`         | `/api/meatspace/post/sessions`        | List scored test sessions.                                     |
| `POST`        | `/api/meatspace/post/sessions`        | Record an idempotent scored test session.                      |
| `POST`        | `/api/meatspace/post/training/runs`   | Atomically record one completed training run and all attempts. |
| `POST`        | `/api/meatspace/post/training`        | Backward-compatible single-attempt adapter.                    |
| `GET`         | `/api/meatspace/post/progress`        | Current progress.                                              |
| `GET`         | `/api/meatspace/post/stats`           | Aggregate stats.                                               |
| `GET`         | `/api/meatspace/post/recommendations` | Recommended next drills.                                       |

For a training run, generate one UUID run id and stable attempt ids before the request. Retry the identical payload after transport failure; the server upserts those ids in one transaction and returns success only after the full batch is durable. Use `/sessions` only for scored tests, keeping training evidence out of benchmark history.

## 7. iCloud-JSON sync precedent (POST-progress reconciliation)

The working reference for "iOS app writes an iCloud JSON file, PortOS ingests it" is MortalLoom (`server/routes/mortalloom.js`, `server/services/mortalLoomStore.js`):

* `GET /api/mortalloom/status` — store status.
* `POST /api/mortalloom/import` — non-destructive **by-id merge** of the shared iCloud JSON into `data/`.

A POST-progress iCloud reconciliation endpoint would need an explicit privacy design before it can mirror this precedent. Until then there is no cross-instance POST reconciliation — a companion app reads and writes each instance's `/api/meatspace/post/*` routes directly (see the note in §6).

## Deferred follow-ups (filed separately)

* Privacy-reviewed POST-progress reconciliation design (no federation by default).
* Server-side audio/STT upload endpoint — only if on-device transcription is abandoned.
* Push-notification / reminder plumbing to prompt POST training from the phone.
* A dedicated companion `apiRegistry.js` public group + per-device API token, if the single-password posture proves insufficient.
