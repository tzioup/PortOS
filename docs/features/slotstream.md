# Slotstream — SSD-streaming MoE runtime

[Slotstream](https://github.com/carloslfu/slotstream) is a separately managed
local runtime for Apple Silicon that runs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) checkpoint
larger than the machine's RAM: it keeps a small dense trunk resident and
streams the routed experts a token actually needs from SSD into a fixed cache
of slots. Cache size trades speed against memory and **never changes output**
— a smaller cache is slower, not less accurate. The technique only pays off on
a MoE checkpoint, where a handful of experts are active per token; a dense
checkpoint of the same size would stream every byte of every layer for every
token and crawl, which is why PortOS offers a curated checkpoint list rather
than an open Hugging Face search.

This is an additional runtime, not a replacement for Ollama or LM Studio.
PortOS exposes it as an `api`/`tui` local provider like every other local
runtime; the `slotstream` entry lives in `LOCAL_RUNTIMES`
(`server/lib/localProviderRuntime.js`).

## Platform gate

Slotstream is Apple-Silicon-only. `isAppleSilicon()`
(`server/lib/platform.js`) gates install and start; on any other host or
architecture the card reports **"Slotstream runs only on macOS with Apple
Silicon."** and offers no install button.

## Where it is managed

**Models → LLMs** is the home for Slotstream's lifecycle, in the same **Local
Runtime Servers** table as Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp and MTPLX
(`client/src/components/settings/RuntimeServersCard.jsx`):

- The row offers **Install**, **Start** (enabled once a checkpoint is cached),
  **Stop**, **Configure**, and an **Idle release** window — Slotstream is the
  one runtime besides llama.cpp and MTPLX with an idle-release field.
- The **Slotstream (SSD-streaming MoE)** card below it
  (`client/src/components/settings/SlotstreamServerCard.jsx`) picks which
  cached checkpoint, which port, and an optional memory-cap override; **saves
  that as the launch line an on-demand start replays**; shows the memory plan;
  and is where checkpoints are downloaded.

PortOS runs Slotstream as a **PM2 process named `portos-slotstream`**, exactly
like `portos-mtplx` and `portos-llama-server`. So `pm2 list` shows it next to
the rest of the install, `pm2 logs portos-slotstream` has its output, and a
PortOS restart re-adopts a server it started earlier by reading the launch
config back off the running process's own PM2 args
(`parseConfigFromArgs` in `server/services/slotstreamServerManager.js`).

## The dedicated port

Slotstream always binds an explicit `--port`, defaulting to
`PORTS.SLOTSTREAM` (`server/lib/ports.js`) — a loopback port dedicated to
Slotstream. Port `11434` is refused outright
(`SLOTSTREAM_OLLAMA_PORT_ERROR`): that is Ollama's default, and a
PortOS-managed Ollama already listens there, so a Slotstream server on the
same port would silently steal its traffic instead of failing loudly.

## Setup

1. **Install** from **Local Runtime Servers**. `installSlotstream()`
   downloads the Apple Silicon release from GitHub Releases
   (`gh release download --repo carloslfu/slotstream`) into
   `~/.slotstream/bin` and extracts it — it needs the GitHub CLI (`gh`) on
   `PATH`; without it the install refuses with
   `SLOTSTREAM_INSTALL_UNAVAILABLE` rather than trying an unauthenticated
   fallback. This step never downloads model weights.
2. **Download a checkpoint** from the Slotstream card's **Add a checkpoint**
   picker — a curated list (`SLOTSTREAM_CATALOG` in
   `server/lib/slotstreamCatalog.js`) of three Hugging Face MoE checkpoints
   sized from "small enough to verify the install end to end" up to the
   235B-class headline case. Picking one and pressing **Download checkpoint**
   previews the size and free disk, then streams the transfer with byte
   progress over the `slotstream:download` socket event; the download resumes
   from a partial file if interrupted, and stalls (no bytes for 20 minutes by
   default) are abandoned rather than hung forever, resumable on the next
   press. Every downloaded file is checked against the hash Hugging Face
   published for it (`expectedSha256` in `streamResumableDownload`) before it
   counts as finished; a mismatch fails the install and removes the partial
   file rather than leaving a silently corrupt checkpoint on disk. PortOS also
   accepts a plain Hugging Face `owner/name` outside the curated list, as long
   as the repo is a Slotstream-loadable MoE checkpoint. Nothing downloads
   without this explicit press.
3. **Start Slotstream** on the card, or **Save configuration** to store the
   choice for a later on-demand start without starting it now. Either way,
   Slotstream never fetches weights at start time — a start reads
   `~/.slotstream/models` (or `SLOTSTREAM_MODEL_DIR`, see below) and refuses
   with a clear message if nothing servable is cached, rather than trying to
   fetch the requested checkpoint.
4. Enable the **Slotstream (SSD-streaming MoE)** preset on **AI Providers** —
   see below — or point any `api`/`tui` provider at the endpoint by hand, and
   use it for supported tasks.

## AI Providers preset

`data.reference/providers.json` ships a `slotstream` preset (`api` type,
`http://127.0.0.1:5564/v1`, **disabled by default** — the same
consent-before-cost posture as the download itself) and migration 340 seeds it
into existing installs. It offers the curated catalog's three checkpoint ids
as candidate models, defaulting to the 235B-class headline case; whichever
checkpoint is actually cached and started is what answers, regardless of which
catalog id the request names.

Unlike MTPLX, Slotstream gets no `opencode-slotstream` CLI/TUI wrapper: it is
text-only, so it is not a valid CoS coding-agent runner. `isSlotstreamProvider`
(`server/services/slotstreamServerManager.js`) recognizes any `api`/`tui`
provider pointed at `PORTS.SLOTSTREAM` — including a hand-added one, not only
this preset — so `ensureSlotstreamProviderReady` lazy-starts the runtime for
it the same way.

## Memory plan

`planSlotstreamMemory()` (`server/lib/slotstreamModels.js`) computes the
expert-cache target before every start and is shown on both the card and the
Local Runtime Servers row:

- **Auto target** — `max(6 GB, min(totalRam × 0.67, max(6 GB, totalRam − 8
  GB)))`, leaving headroom so the rest of PortOS is not paged out.
- **Floor** — `SLOTSTREAM_MEMORY_FLOOR_GB` (6 GB): the smallest cache a dense
  trunk plus a workable expert pool still runs on.
- **Expected peak** — reported equal to the target; this is the ceiling the
  cache is capped at, not a separate measurement.
- **Expected warm decode** — a throughput estimate scaled linearly from one
  measured reference point (~12 tok/s at a 32 GB target), so it moves with the
  chosen target but is a rough guide, not a benchmark.
- **Override** — the Memory cap field on the card sets an explicit `--memory-gb`
  instead of the auto target (still floored at 6 GB). The override — not the
  resolved number — is what gets persisted, so an auto-sized start stays
  reported as "auto" instead of freezing whatever RAM happened to compute to
  on that boot.

## Cache layout

Each subdirectory of the cache directory is one checkpoint, named after the
value a start hands `--model`. The default location is
`~/.slotstream/models`; set `SLOTSTREAM_MODEL_DIR` to use a different
directory (a second drive, for instance) — `slotstreamCacheDir()` is the one
place that decision is made, so the manager, the model lister and the
downloader always agree on where the cache is. A checkpoint downloaded through
the catalog picker lands at `<cache>/<owner>__<name>` (the repo id's `/`
flattened to `__`, since the directory name is also the id a start selects).
A directory holding a `.partial` (an in-progress or abandoned download) is not
counted as a servable checkpoint — Slotstream reports an empty cache rather
than trying to serve a half-downloaded one.

## What a start does and does not do

- **A start never downloads weights**, in either direction it can be
  triggered: pressing **Start Slotstream** on the card, or the first PortOS
  request routed to a Slotstream-backed provider firing lazy start
  (`ensureSlotstreamRunning()`). Both read the on-disk cache and refuse with
  the same message when it is empty. Only the explicit **Download checkpoint**
  button in the previous section ever fetches weights.
- A start with no checkpoint requested picks the first cached one
  (`pickSlotstreamCachedModel`); an explicitly named checkpoint is verified
  against the cache first — `slotstream serve` would otherwise treat an
  unknown name as something to fetch, which is exactly the implicit-download
  path PortOS refuses to open.
- If the requested port is already answering an OpenAI-compatible server, or
  is in use by anything else, the start refuses rather than clobbering
  whatever is already listening.
- A process that exits immediately after `pm2 start` (a bad flag, a corrupt
  checkpoint) is diagnosed from its own PM2 log tail and the PM2 entry is torn
  down, rather than being left around reporting a phantom "running" state.
- Started outside PortOS (someone ran `slotstream serve` by hand on the same
  port), the card reports **Running (external)** with no Stop button — PortOS
  never stops a process it did not start.

## Idle release and lazy start

Slotstream's whole resident state — trunk plus expert cache — sits in one
process for as long as it is up, same shape as MTPLX and llama.cpp.

**Idle release.** Set a window in minutes on the Slotstream row under Local
Runtime Servers. When no PortOS request has been routed to Slotstream for
that long, PortOS stops `portos-slotstream`
(`registerIdleDaemon`/`idleWindowMs` in `server/lib/managedDaemon.js`) and the
memory comes back. `0` (the default) means never.

**Lazy start.** The next PortOS request routed to Slotstream starts it and
waits for readiness (`ensureSlotstreamRunning`). It comes back on the launch
line it last used — the saved checkpoint, port and memory-cap override — so a
released server returns exactly as configured rather than re-guessing.
**Only PortOS traffic counts** toward the idle timer; a client hitting the
Slotstream port directly is invisible to it.

Unlike MTPLX, the Local Runtime Servers row also offers a manual **Start**
button once a checkpoint is cached — Slotstream does not rely on lazy start
alone.

## Startup at boot

Like `portos-mtplx`, `portos-slotstream` is deliberately excluded from **Save
PM2 list for reboot** (`server/routes/localLlm.js`, the `saveProcessList`
call's `exclude` list) — it starts on demand, so resurrecting it at boot would
pin whichever checkpoint and memory cap happened to be saved on a machine
nobody has asked anything of yet. The running process, if any, is left alone;
it just is not in the dump a reboot replays.

## API surface

`server/routes/localLlm.js` exposes the lifecycle under
`/api/local-llm/slotstream/*`:

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /slotstream/status` | Binary presence, running state, endpoint, memory plan, cached checkpoints, cache directory/error, the curated catalog, recent log lines. |
| `POST /slotstream/start` | Launch `slotstream serve` under PM2 with the given (or saved) checkpoint/port/memory cap; streams progress. |
| `POST /slotstream/stop` | Stop the managed process. |
| `POST /slotstream/install` | Download and extract the Apple Silicon binary. |
| `POST /slotstream/models/download` | Fetch one catalog (or `owner/name`) checkpoint into the cache; streams byte progress on the `slotstream:download` socket event. |

`POST /api/local-llm/download-preflight` also accepts `{ kind: 'slotstream', model }` to
preview a checkpoint download's size and free-disk verdict before the confirm
step commits to it.

## Operational notes

- Keep the Slotstream endpoint local. The dedicated port is a loopback
  address; if you intentionally change that, treat the server and its cached
  weights as a separate trusted runtime.
- A checkpoint download can run for a long time (100 GB+ for the largest
  catalog entry) — PortOS fetches one checkpoint at a time; a second request
  while one is in flight is refused rather than interleaved.
- Slotstream was integrated by PortOS; it is not PortOS's own project. See
  [carloslfu/slotstream](https://github.com/carloslfu/slotstream) for the
  runtime itself, its supported checkpoint formats, and its own release
  notes.
