# Brain Second-Brain System

Offline-first "second brain" management system for capturing, classifying, and surfacing thoughts.

## Overview

Brain provides a capture-classify-store-surface workflow:

1. **Capture**: Dump thoughts into a single inbox
2. **Classify**: AI routes thoughts to appropriate databases
3. **Store**: Persist to People, Projects, Ideas, or Admin
4. **Surface**: Daily digests and weekly reviews

## Features

1. **Chat-like Inbox**: Single input for capturing thoughts
2. **AI Classification**: LM Studio classifies with confidence scores
3. **Four Databases**: People, Projects, Ideas, Admin
4. **Needs Review Queue**: Low-confidence items await user decision
5. **Fix/Correct Flow**: Reclassify misrouted thoughts
6. **Daily Digest**: AI-generated summary of actions and status
7. **Weekly Review**: GTD-style open loops and accomplishments
8. **Trust Panel**: Full audit trail of classifications
9. **YouTube Ingest**: Pull a video's transcript (and optionally the video/audio) into the brain, mirror the transcript to Obsidian, and queue an agent to act on it

```

Each `collectionStore` directory contains a schema-versioned `index.json` and stores every record at `<id>/index.json`.

## AI Classification

The classifier uses LM Studio to analyze captured thoughts and:

* Determine the appropriate database (People, Projects, Ideas, Admin)
* Extract structured data (names, dates, priorities, etc.)
* Calculate confidence score (0.0-1.0)
* Provide reasoning for classification decision

### Confidence Levels

* **High (≥0.8)**: Auto-routed to database
* **Medium (0.5-0.8)**: Suggested route, user can confirm or change
* **Low (<0.5)**: Marked "needs review", user must choose

## Daily Digest

Generated daily (configurable schedule):

* Summary of captured thoughts
* Actions taken
* Projects with recent activity
* People interacted with
* Admin items due soon
* Ideas ready for next steps

## Weekly Review

Generated weekly (GTD-style):

* Open loops by database
* Accomplishments
* Projects to review
* People to follow up with
* Ideas to explore
* Admin items to address

## YouTube Ingest

Paste a single-video YouTube URL into **Quick Capture** (dashboard widget) and the submit path switches from `/api/brain/capture` to `/api/brain/youtube/ingest`. A sliders button next to the input expands the advanced panel: which artifacts to capture, a free-text prompt for a follow-up agent, and tags.

**Three independent switches** — at least one is required:

| Switch                        | Produces                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `captureTranscript` (default) | `data/brain/youtube/<videoId>.md`, mirrored into the Obsidian vault                                   |
| `downloadVideo`               | A `source: 'download'` entry in the shared media library (same shape the Dev Tools downloader writes) |
| `ingestAudio`                 | `data/brain/youtube/<videoId>.mp3`, kept next to the transcript                                       |

**Always recorded, regardless of switches:**

* a brain `links` record (federated — the durable "saved for future reference" artifact), and
* a `media.watch` row in `human_activity_events` (machine-local), so the video appears on the Timeline next to passively-synced watch history.

**The agent prompt.** Supplying `agentPrompt` queues a CoS task pointed at the stored transcript with that prompt as its brief — "here is what I want done with this content." Leaving it blank queues nothing: PortOS never starts AI work the user did not ask for (see the AI Provider Usage Policy in the root `AGENTS.md`).

**Transcripts.** yt-dlp is asked for English captions; the metadata dump's `subtitles` key (not the produced filename, which is identical for both kinds) distinguishes human-authored captions from auto-generated ones, and that lands on the record as `transcript.source`. YouTube's auto-captions are a rolling two-line display where each cue repeats the previous one, so `server/lib/vttTranscript.js` collapses the repetition and strips inline markup — a 14-minute talk goes from 128 KB of VTT to \~14 KB of prose. A video with no captions is **not** a failure: the ingest completes with a warning and everything else is still stored.

**Obsidian.** The transcript note is written to the vault configured under **Brain → Config → YouTube Ingest**. An unset vault inherits the Daily Log's, so anyone who already pointed the journal at Obsidian needs no setup. The note carries YAML frontmatter (title, source, channel, duration, published, captured, tags) so vault queries and Dataview can find it.

**Storage.** `data/brain/youtube/index.json` is machine-local and never federated — every field in it is a local path, an Obsidian vault id, or a local video-history id. See [STORAGE.md](../storage.md).

**Requirements.** `yt-dlp` on PATH for any ingest; `ffmpeg` additionally for the video/audio switches (a transcript-only ingest works without it).

## IdeaLoom Obsidian exchange

The dedicated `/brain/ideas` page keeps native Brain ideas separate from machine-local IdeaLoom lists. When the integration is enabled and an existing Obsidian vault is selected, the page exposes explicit Import and Export actions. Neither action runs during boot, and disabled or unconfigured integration does not affect local list editing.

Import scans only the vault's `Idea Loom/` folder. A supported note has UUID, title, category, draft/completed status, created/modified timestamps, an IdeaLoom tag, a prompt heading, optional help text, and dense numbered idea lines. Imports preserve the UUID, order, timestamps, and discovered note path; malformed, duplicate, and iCloud-unavailable notes are reported in the result instead of being silently accepted. Export writes the same frontmatter and numbered Markdown shape, uses a date/title filename for new lists, and keeps an imported filename stable.

The exchange result includes counts and per-note details for imported, exported, skipped, conflicted, missing, malformed, unavailable, and failed work. Each stays a distinct outcome so a deleted note never reads as a failed one. List records and vault identifiers remain under `data/brain/idealoom-lists/` and never enter Brain federation or the memory bridge.

### Conflicts

Every exchanged list stores the hash of the note as it was last read or written. That hash is the base for the next comparison:

| Vault note vs. base | Local list vs. base | Outcome                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| unchanged           | unchanged           | `skipped` (`unchanged`) — nothing is written                          |
| changed             | unchanged           | import updates the list; export reports `skipped` (`external-change`) |
| unchanged           | changed             | export writes the note                                                |
| changed             | changed             | `conflicted` (`both-sides-changed`) — **neither side is overwritten** |

A conflict is resolved by hand: edit whichever side you want to keep so the other becomes the only changed one, then run the exchange again.

### Deletions

Deleting a vault note is treated as a decision, never as drift to repair. A list whose note is gone is reported as `missing` (`note-deleted-externally`) by both import and export, and **nothing is written** — the local list is kept so nothing is lost. Recreating the note takes an explicit "Recreate deleted notes" action, which is the only path that sets `recreateMissing`. In the other direction, deleting a local list leaves its vault note alone: removing the note is done in Obsidian.

An iCloud note that has not been downloaded to this Mac is `unavailable`, not `missing` — the file still exists, so it is never a recovery candidate.

### Automatic sync

Automatic export is off by default and needs two separate opt-ins: vault sync enabled with a vault chosen, then **Export automatically after an edit**. Both are re-read when the write actually fires, so turning either off cancels work already queued. Automatic writes are debounced, so reordering a list one click at a time is a single note write.

Automatic sync is deliberately the least powerful path in the feature. It can only ever update an existing note whose content differs from the list: it never deletes a note, never recreates a deleted one, and never resolves a conflict. Anything it cannot do safely is reported and waits for an explicit action.

There is no import/export feedback loop: only a local list edit schedules an automatic export, and an export whose rendered Markdown already matches the note on disk is skipped instead of rewritten, so a freshly imported list does not export itself back.

## Setup Requirements

**LM Studio** must be running with a capable chat model:

1. Download and install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
2. Load a chat model (e.g., gptoss-20b, qwen-2.5, etc.)
3. Start the local server on port 1234 (default)
4. Configure the Brain system to use the model

## Configuration

```javascript
brain: {
  enabled: true,
  provider: 'lmstudio',
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions',
  model: 'gptoss-20b',
  minConfidence: 0.5,
  digestSchedule: '0 18 * * *',  // Daily at 6pm
  reviewSchedule: '0 9 * * 0'    // Weekly on Sunday at 9am
}
```

## Workflow Example

```
1. User captures: "Met with Sarah about the new project. Need to follow up next week."

2. AI classifies:
   - Database: People + Projects
   - Confidence: 0.85
   - Reasoning: "Mentions person (Sarah) and project context with action item"

3. System creates:
   - Person record: "Sarah" with last interaction today
   - Project record: "New project" with status "planned"
   - Admin task: "Follow up with Sarah" due next week

4. Daily digest includes:
   - "New person added: Sarah"
   - "New project started: New project"
   - "Action due: Follow up with Sarah"

5. Weekly review shows:
   - Open loop: "New project (planned) - needs next actions"
   - Follow-up needed: "Sarah - follow up scheduled"
```
