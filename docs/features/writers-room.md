# Writers Room

Writers Room is the PortOS workspace for creating, organizing, editing, analyzing, and adapting literary works: a focused writing environment with manual AI passes, a story bible, storyboarding, and bridges into the Creative Director and comic-pipeline media systems.

Every AI evaluation and render action is user-initiated or explicitly opted into — nothing runs on keystrokes or draft saves without the per-work Live Director opt-in described below. One user click can fan out, though: running the Adapt flow auto-queues an image render for every missing storyboard scene once the script lands (see Storyboard & Media).

## Navigation & Layout

Routes (registered in `App.jsx` and `server/lib/navManifest.js` — `nav.writers-room`, `nav.writers-room.guide`):

- `/writers-room` — landing (library + editor)
- `/writers-room/works/:workId` — active work editor
- `/writers-room/guide` — writing guide (length targets, craft reference)

The page lives in the sidebar's **Create** group. The main workspace is `client/src/pages/WritersRoom.jsx` with a library pane (`LibraryPane.jsx`), the Markdown work editor (`WorkEditor.jsx`), and tool panels. The editor is plain Markdown — stable text ranges, reliable word count, low corruption risk for long prose.

## Writing Exercise ("write for 10")

`ExercisePanel.jsx` runs timed free-write sprints (default 10 minutes, clamped 1–60): start, finish, or discard, with live word count. Sessions can start standalone or attached to a work, and history records date, duration, word deltas, linked work, and prompt. Finished sprint text is stored as `appendedText` on the exercise record. A finished sprint tied to the open work can be added to its active draft; promotion appends the trimmed sprint text, records `promotedAt` and `promotedDraftVersionId`, and keeps the existing draft version and ingredient references.

Not built (deliberately deferred): pause/resume mid-session.

## Storage

Metadata (folders, work manifests, decomposed draft versions, exercises) persists through the storage dispatcher `server/services/writersRoom/store.js`: **PostgreSQL on a normal install** (#1017), with the legacy on-disk JSON layout under `data/writers-room/` remaining only as a dev/test escape hatch. Draft **prose bodies always stay on disk** as Markdown files (`works/<workId>/drafts/<draftVersionId>.md`) regardless of backend — long works never live inside a database row or a giant JSON blob. `store.js` decomposes `drafts[]` into rows on PG and reassembles on read, so the manifest shape is backend-independent.

`server/services/writersRoom/local.js` is the single owner of work/folder/draft/exercise storage; `db.js` is the PG backend.

### Work manifest

Persisted fields: `id`, `folderId`, `title`, `kind` (novel/short-story/screenplay/essay/treatment/other), `status` (idea/drafting/revision/adaptation/rendering/complete/archived), `activeDraftVersionId`, `drafts[]`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. Users can edit `title`, `folderId`, `kind`, `status`, `imageStyle`, and the partial-merged `liveMode` config. Server-owned link fields are stamped by their own flows, never by user PATCH: `mediaCollectionId` (auto-created media collection), `cdProjectId` (Creative Director link), `pipelineSeriesId`/`pipelineIssueId` (comic-pipeline promotion).

### Draft versions

Each draft version records `id`, `label`, `contentFile`, `contentHash`, `wordCount`, `segmentIndex`, `createdAt`, `createdFromVersionId`. The **segment index** (chapter/scene/paragraph ranges with character offsets) is the foundation for stale-analysis detection and the synced review surface — AI outputs attach to a draft version and to specific segment IDs.

## Analysis (manual AI passes)

`server/services/writersRoom/evaluator.js` runs user-clicked passes against the active draft, pinning the source draft's `contentHash` so the UI can flag stale results when the prose changes. Analysis kinds map to prompt stages in `data.reference/prompts/stages/`:

| Kind | Stage | Output |
|------|-------|--------|
| `evaluate` | `writers-room-evaluate.md` | Editorial evaluation of the draft |
| `format` | `writers-room-format.md` | Formatting/structure pass |
| `script` | `writers-room-script.md` | Screenplay-style scenes mapped back to prose segment IDs |
| `characters` | `writers-room-characters.md` | Character extraction into the story bible |
| `places` | `writers-room-places.md` | Place extraction |
| `objects` | `writers-room-objects.md` | Object extraction |

(Two more stages back the live features: `writers-room-continue.md` and `writers-room-cd-bridge.md`.) Most kinds parse the model's JSON response and filter it to the expected fields before persistence; `format` is deliberately non-JSON and persists a shaped Markdown response. Client: `AnalysisHistory.jsx`. Scene images can be attached to script-analysis scenes (`POST .../analysis/:analysisId/scene-image`) and persist into the work's media collection.

## Story Bible

Characters, places, and objects extracted by analysis (or entered by hand) live as per-work bible entities with full CRUD (`characters.js` / `places.js` / `objects.js`; client `CharactersBible.jsx`, `PlacesBible.jsx`, `ObjectsBible.jsx`, `StoryboardBibleTab.jsx`). Extraction merges into existing entries rather than duplicating.

A character carries the same narrative framework the Universe Bible stores — motivations, Ghost → Wound → Lie → Need → Want, the declared arc type, secrets, and structured relationship links — from one definition in `server/lib/characterFramework.js` (mirrored for the editors by `client/src/lib/characterFramework.js`), so the store's editable fields, the route schemas, and both cast editors cannot drift. Every field is optional, and clearing one (`''` / `[]` / `null`) is a real authored state, distinct from omitting the key. Prose extraction may PROPOSE framework values but never overwrites an authored one, and the author-side `evaluate` pass receives the cast's framework so it reports delivery against the writer's plan rather than inferring both from the same draft. Promotion to the Pipeline copies the whole framework — including `wr-char-` ids, so relationship links still resolve inside the minted universe.

## Storyboard & Media

The storyboard suite (`StoryboardPanel.jsx`, `StoryboardScenesTab.jsx`, `StoryboardBoardsTab.jsx`, `StoryboardConfigTab.jsx`, `SceneCard.jsx`) turns script-analysis scenes into rendered boards through the existing image-gen pipeline and media job queue. When the Adapt flow completes, the panel auto-queues a render for every scene that doesn't have an image yet — one Adapt click implies the whole board's image cost. Scene images ride the shared media-collection infrastructure — a work auto-creates its collection on first render.

There is no persisted "render plan" store (the originally planned `render-plans` endpoints were never built); scene→media mapping is derived on read (see Synchronized Review below) and Creative Director handoff goes through the CD bridge.

## Creative Director Bridge

The live-mode sidebar can turn the prose around the cursor into a short Creative Director **treatment** — logline, synopsis, overall visual treatment, and 2–6 filmable scenes (beat + visual prompt + duration). The writer reviews the proposal in the CD Bridge panel (`CdBridgePanel.jsx`) and sends it into a **new** Creative Director project seeded with that treatment (`POST .../cd-bridge/suggest` + `.../cd-bridge/send`, backed by the `writers-room-cd-bridge` stage). The bridge is non-destructive — it always creates a fresh project — and the work links to it via `cdProjectId` with an "Open in Creative Director" jump.

## Pipeline Promotion

`POST /works/:id/promote-to-pipeline` (`promoteToPipeline.js`) promotes a work into the comic pipeline, creating a series and first issue and stamping `pipelineSeriesId`/`pipelineIssueId` on the manifest.

## Live Director (opt-in realtime assistance)

`server/services/writersRoom/liveDirector.js` powers the editor's per-work, off-by-default "Live Director" mode:

- **Live continuation** — while the writer pauses, asks for 2–4 short continuation options (beats, insertable prose snippets, dialogue lines) from the prose around the cursor, surfaced in `LiveContinuationPanel.jsx`; `prose`/`dialogue` options insert at the caret. Backed by the `writers-room-continue` stage (quick tier).
- **Live render previews** — on-demand scene render reservations (`LiveRenderPanel.jsx`), with a separate daily render budget.

Controls are enforced server-side, not just in the UI: per-work opt-in toggle (requests 409 when off), a client debounce after typing stops (`liveMode.debounceMs`, default 2.5s), and daily budgets (`liveMode.dailyCallBudget`, default 100, `0` = unlimited; plus `dailyRenderBudget`) that roll over at UTC midnight and 429 when spent. Usage counters are server-owned and stripped from user updates.

## Synchronized Review Surface

`GET /works/:id/synced-review` (`server/services/writersRoom/syncedReview.js`, client `SyncedReview.jsx`) lets the user see how a story maps across forms — prose, script, and media side by side, with selection sync between panes.

The mapping model is a **relational read-model derived on request** rather than a persisted mapping store:

- Prose segments come from the active draft's `segmentIndex`.
- Script scenes come from the latest `script` analysis, whose scenes carry `sourceSegmentIds` back-references.
- Media comes from the analysis snapshot's scene-image map.
- Cast integrity comes from the per-work character bible, measured by the shared `server/lib/characterIntegrity.js` contract (#6415) and joined to the scenes that stage each character.

Selecting prose highlights the mapped script and media; media cards show provenance (source segments, prompt, model, render job). Staleness falls out of the pinned analysis `sourceContentHash` — when the draft's hash differs, the UI shows stale badges and requires a deliberate re-run. Media attached to scenes that no longer exist after re-extraction is surfaced explicitly as orphaned rather than silently dropped.

The **Cast pane** is where the cold read of the draft meets author knowledge, and the two are deliberately kept apart. Findings are the deterministic, zero-provider completeness pass over the AUTHORED bible — a character the prose stages vividly still reports every unauthored framework field, because an interior that lives only in the author's head is the defect. What the script extraction saw is reported beside it as `staged` (never as a repair): an authored character no scene stages is a fact rather than a flag, and a name the extraction found with no bible entry is listed under `staging.unmatchedNames` rather than becoming a finding the report has no record to attach. Depth rulings come from the same contract, so a declared minor role or flat arc is held to the conscious pursuit only. No model reads the cast to BUILD this report (`semanticReviewedCount` is 0 and `passed` is false by construction); the cast-wide semantic review still lives in the Universe Bible's Cast Integrity panel.

**Selective augmentation** (#6417) is the write half, reached from a per-character *Sharpen* button that appears only on findings a model can actually repair — a `contradictory` finding never offers one, because nothing but the author can decide which of two disagreeing fields is wrong. Propose writes nothing and returns before/after per field; the author ticks what to keep and only those paths are applied. The proposal carries the character's fingerprint, so an edit that lands while the model is thinking gets a 409 rather than an overwrite. Peers sent to the model are this work's OWN cast — a work bible is work-local, and a universe roster would pull a draft toward a cast it has not been promoted into. The call, the field contract and the prompt stage are shared with the Universe cast editor via `server/services/characterAugmentation.js`.

## Federation

Writers Room content syncs across peers: record kinds `writersRoomWork`, `writersRoomFolder`, and `writersRoomExercise` (`syncLogic.js`) map to the sync categories `writersRoomWorks`/`writersRoomFolders`/`writersRoomExercises` registered in `server/lib/schemaVersions.js`, with per-record peer-sync push (#1565/#1645). `local.js` emits record events through `sharing/recordEvents.js`; draft `.md` bodies ride a dedicated `draftBodyManifest` lane on work pushes (SHA256 per draft), while scene images sync through the work's linked media collection's asset path rather than the Writers Room records themselves. Conflict-restore handlers cover exercises and bodyless records.

## API Surface

All under `/api/writers-room` (`server/routes/writersRoom.js`, client wrapper `client/src/services/apiWritersRoom.js`):

- **Folders** — `GET/POST /folders`, `DELETE /folders/:id`
- **Works** — `GET/POST /works`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /works/:id`, `POST /works/:id/promote-to-pipeline`
- **Drafts/versions** — `PUT /works/:id/draft`, `POST /works/:id/versions`, `GET/PATCH /works/:id/versions/:draftId` (PATCH sets active)
- **Exercises** — `GET/POST /exercises`, `POST /exercises/:id/finish`, `POST /exercises/:id/discard`
- **Analysis** — `GET/POST /works/:id/analysis`, `GET /works/:id/analysis/:analysisId`, `POST .../scene-image`
- **Live director** — `POST /works/:id/live-suggest`, `POST /works/:id/live-render-preview`, `POST /works/:id/cd-bridge/{suggest,send}`
- **Synced review** — `GET /works/:id/synced-review`
- **Story bible** — `GET/POST /works/:id/{characters,places,objects}`, `PATCH/DELETE /works/:id/{characters,places,objects}/:entityId`
- **Cast augmentation** — `POST /works/:id/characters/:characterId/augment` (propose, writes nothing), `POST /works/:id/characters/:characterId/augment/apply` (apply the ticked subset; 409 on a stale fingerprint)

Route inputs are Zod-validated at the boundary (`server/lib/validation.js`), except the scene-image attach route, which validates its fields inside `attachSceneImage` instead.

## Tests

Most services carry sibling `.test.js` suites (storage CRUD, draft save/version/content-hash behavior, segment indexing, analysis stale detection, exercise lifecycle, live-director gating/budgets, synced-review derivation, sync logic). `server/lib/navManifest.test.js` covers the nav entries; route validation is covered in the routes suite.
