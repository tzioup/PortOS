# Chief of Staff Enhancement (M35)

> **Status:** This M35 milestone spec shipped, except the Phase 5 agent-architecture services (`agentGateway.js`, `errorRecovery.js`, `agentRunCache.js`, `contextUpgrader.js`) and `sessionDelta.js`, which were never built under those names. Their rows below are marked "(not built)" and kept for historical legibility.

Comprehensive upgrade from reactive task executor to proactive autonomous agent with hybrid memory, missions, local model integration, and dynamic thinking levels.

## Features

### Phase 1: Hybrid Memory Search

- BM25 algorithm with IDF weighting and inverted index
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) combining BM25 + vector search
- 40% BM25 / 60% vector weighting for optimal retrieval
- Session delta tracking for pending bytes/messages

### Phase 2: Proactive Execution

- Event scheduler with cron expressions and timeout-safe timers (clamps to 2^31-1)
- Execution lanes: critical (1), standard (2), background (3) concurrent slots
- Mission system for long-term goals with sub-tasks
- Mission-driven task generation in evaluation loop

### Phase 3: Local Model Integration

- LM Studio availability checking and model discovery
- Quick completions for local thinking without cloud costs
- Memory classification using local models
- Embeddings via local LM Studio

### Phase 4: Dynamic Model Selection

- Thinking levels: off, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh
- Level resolution hierarchy: task → hooks → agent → provider
- Context upgrader with complexity analysis
- COS self-evolution with automatic model changes

### Phase 5: Agent Architecture

- Tool execution state machine (IDLE → START → RUNNING → UPDATE → END → ERROR)
- Agent gateway with request deduplication and 10-minute cache
- Error recovery with 6 strategies: retry, escalate, fallback, decompose, defer, investigate
- Agent run cache for outputs, tool results, and contexts

## Execution Lanes

| Lane | Concurrent Slots | Purpose |
|------|------------------|---------|
| critical | 1 | Emergency fixes, blocking issues |
| standard | 2 | Normal development tasks |
| background | 3 | Self-improvement, documentation |

## Thinking Levels

| Level | Description | Model Tier |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| off | No extended thinking | light |
| minimal | Brief analysis | light |
| low | Standard analysis | medium |
| medium | Thorough analysis | medium |
| high | Deep analysis | heavy |
| xhigh | Maximum analysis | heavy |

## Error Recovery Strategies

| Strategy | When Used |
|----------|-----------|
| retry | Transient errors (rate limit, timeout) |
| escalate | Persistent failures requiring human review |
| fallback | Model unavailable, try alternative |
| decompose | Complex task, break into subtasks |
| defer | Non-urgent, schedule for later |
| investigate | Unknown error, create investigation task |

## API Endpoints

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| GET /api/lmstudio/status | Check LM Studio availability |
| GET /api/lmstudio/models | List loaded models |
| POST /api/lmstudio/completion | Local model completion |
| POST /api/lmstudio/analyze-task | Analyze task complexity |
| POST /api/lmstudio/classify-memory | Classify memory content |

## Design Decisions

1. **Mission Autonomy**: Full autonomy - COS can implement changes, run tests, commit without approval for managed apps
2. **Model Usage**: Local-first with LM Studio, no cloud API costs for thinking
3. **Persistent Mind model control**: The default profile is human-owned. An optional grant permits one approved local preset on a self-directed wake; the mind cannot rewrite provider configuration.
4. **Failure Investigation**: Unattended by default - an `[Auto] Investigate agent failure` task runs without approval, because an isolated agent failure is exactly the work CoS exists to diagnose for itself. Approval is reserved for a failure *loop*, where another unattended agent would only repeat what already didn't work: the same cause investigated again within 24h (`repeat-fingerprint`), or the circuit-breaker hour already one slot from its cap (`failure-storm`). The reason is stamped on the task as the producer-agnostic `metadata.approvalReason` (`investigation-loop:<signal>`), which the Tasks UI turns into a hint on the APPROVE button. See `resolveInvestigationApproval` in `server/services/agentErrorAnalysis.js`.

## Persistent Mind task filing

The Persistent Mind has one explicit, default-off typed action, `cos.create-task`.
When the grant is enabled, each wake receives a bounded server-built catalog of
runnable apps and enabled CLI/TUI coding providers. The catalog includes each
provider's selectable models and effort levels, and marks apps whose effective
work tracker supports the issue-only **Plan & File Issue** workflow.

The mind may select the provider, model, effort, priority, delivery mode, and PR
completion policy per request. Implementation mode requires one of
`review-then-merge`, `merge-on-green`, or `leave-open`; plan-only mode is only
valid for GitHub/GitLab apps and is normalized to the existing unattended
`plan-task --yes` no-code/no-PR contract. The queue path revalidates every choice
after inference, so stale prompts, disabled providers, invented model ids, and
unsupported trackers fail closed.

Task model selection can be restricted in Persistent Mind Tools with an exact
provider/model allowlist. An empty list preserves the unrestricted catalog; a
non-empty list is applied to both the model choices sent to the mind and the
server-side queue admission check, which supports subscription-specific or
local-only task lanes. A removed or malformed allowlist fails closed.

`GET /api/cos/mind/tools` returns the authority inventory and, when task access is
granted, the same redacted task catalog used in the mind prompt. This keeps the
Mind Tools UI and the model-facing contract discoverable without granting the
mind arbitrary shell, filesystem, or general API access. Broader PortOS APIs
remain governed by their own authenticated route contracts and are not silently
made callable by enabling task filing.

## Persistent Mind phone calls

`voice.call-user` is the mind's only outward-reaching authority, and like every
other grant it is **off by default** — an install upgrading with the mind
already running gains nothing until the user turns it on in **Mind → Tools**.
It lets the mind place a FaceTime Audio call to the single handle configured in
**Settings → Voice → FaceTime Audio**. The request the model returns
(`callRequest: { reason, openingLine }`) carries no recipient, so a confused or
compromised turn cannot dial anyone else.

The gate lives in `server/services/persistentMindCallCapability.js` and runs
*after* inference. A call is placed only when all of these hold:

| Check | Suppression reason |
|---|---|
| The grant is on (re-read from stored config) | `not-granted` |
| The optional **FaceTime** feature is enabled | `feature-disabled` |
| Voice is enabled and an identity is saved | `voice-disabled`, `identity-unconfigured` |
| No browser tab can speak the message instead | `tab-available` |
| The user's local time is outside voice quiet hours | `quiet-hours` |
| No call is already up | `call-in-progress` |
| ≥30 minutes since the last call, ≤3 calls in the last 24 h | `too-soon`, `rate-capped` |
| A call-host tab is attached and the helper dials | `no-call-host`, `dial-failed` |

The caps are counted in durable Persistent Mind state (`callHistory`), so a
restart, a crash, or a supervisor rewire cannot hand back a fresh allowance. The
budget is spent only on a call that actually went out. Every decision — placed
or suppressed, and why — is appended to the trajectory as `mind.call.requested`
plus `mind.call.placed` / `mind.call.suppressed`; the dialed handle is never
written there. When a request is refused, the turn's reply is appended with the
reason, so the mind cannot leave the user waiting for a phone that never rings.

A placed call runs with the mind's persona and a bounded briefing of its
trajectory, speaks the `openingLine` the moment the far end picks up, and hands
the transcript back as a Persistent Mind message on hangup, so the next wake
knows what was said.

**Critical-notification escalation** (Settings → Voice) uses the same gate and
the same budget, but is authorized by its own `facetime.escalateCritical`
setting rather than by the mind's grant. When a `critical` notification is
still unread after `facetime.escalateAfterMinutes` (default 10) and no voice
tab is available, PortOS asks to ring the user with the notification as the
opening line. Off by default.

## Self-directed local thinking presets

In the Mind settings drawer, **Models → Self-directed local thinking** lets the
user enable `chooseThinkingPreset` and approve exact local presets. It defaults
to off on new and upgraded installs and is independent of task-agent model
permissions. Saving preferences and loading the catalog perform no inference.

Only configured direct local API runtimes qualify. Account-backed routes,
CLI/TUI wrappers, and unknown routes are excluded. Approval binds the preset,
provider name, endpoint and runtime; editing these requires renewed approval.
Removing a model, preset, or supported effort refuses the pending selection.

The semantic actions `mind.thinking-presets` and
`mind.request-thinking-preset` expose the approved catalog and a bounded
`{ presetId, reason }` request. One request borrows a preset for the next
self-directed wake; queued human messages and the current turn keep their own
routes. The default profile, memories, and identity are unchanged.

Only one request may be pending or active. At most three are accepted per
rolling 24 hours, with a 30-minute gap. Admission also advances the recorded
attempt time so a delayed wake cannot evade these limits. Cancellation, failed
admission, interruption and restart do not refund allowance. Failed attempts
retire the alternate and schedule an ordinary wake on the default profile.
Existing endpoint slots, CoS capacity, autonomy and per-call budgets still gate
every execution. No tool can extend its own session or edit these permissions.

The same Models panel cancels pending requests and shows recent concise reasons
and outcomes. Disabling the grant cancels the pending request; revoking it during
execution refuses further provider calls. Execution receipts in Sessions show
the actual route and outcome without exposing hidden reasoning. Durable request
records live alongside the existing machine-local mind state; migration 348
preserves prior profiles, grants, and counters.
