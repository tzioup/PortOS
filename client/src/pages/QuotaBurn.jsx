/**
 * Quota Burn — configure the ONE install-level loop that spends subscription
 * quota which would otherwise expire unused.
 *
 * The loop lives in PortOS, not on any managed app: one schedule, one set of
 * per-provider-family windows, and an ordered burn plan per family. Individual
 * jobs decide what the quota goes to — an agent in a named managed app, or a
 * programmatic PortOS job like rendering the universe bible entries that have
 * no image yet.
 *
 * The master switch is the consent gate for the whole feature (AGENTS.md's AI
 * provider policy): with it off nothing here contacts a provider, and the page
 * names the family, provider, model, and work before it can be turned on.

          One loop for this install, but each provider family burns independently: every family whose window is inside its reset
          horizon, above its reserve, and under its dispatch cap (unlimited by default) runs the first job in its plan that has work waiting — one job
          per family per cycle. A plan is a rotation: steps repeat lap after lap until a gate closes, unless you mark one
          “Run once” — one-shot work then drops out after its dispatch until you re-arm it. Turning this on is explicit
          consent to spend those subscriptions on a schedule.
