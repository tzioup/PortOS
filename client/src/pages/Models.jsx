/**
 * Models — the top-level home for everything about the models this machine runs.
 *
 * The section started as three tabs carved out of `/settings/local-llm`, and now
 * covers every KIND of model an install manages (#4728), not just text:
 *
 *   - **3D** — image-to-3D runtime install/repair (TRELLIS.2, Pixal3D).
 *   - **Code Reviewers** — the review-loop chain and its model/effort pins.
 *   - **Embeddings** — the embedding model backing pgvector search.
 *   - **LLMs** — focused runtime, model-library, and abuse-guard sub-routes.
 *   - **LoRAs** — installed image/video adapters.
 *   - **Media** — image/video checkpoints and the Hugging Face cache.
 *   - **Performance** — measured assessments and launch-tuning comparison.
 *   - **Status** — residency plus the downloaded-model inventory.
 *   - **Training** — LoRA fine-tuning datasets and runs.
 *
 * What deliberately stayed OUT is output rather than weights: Three.js Models is
 * a gallery of generated meshes, and `/3d` is the render flow that consumes the
 * runtimes listed here. Audio models stayed in the Music studio too — their
 * picker is not separable from the generate form. Design record:
 * `docs/plans/2026-08-21-models-navigation.md`.
 *
 * `?tab` is a route param, not local state, so every one is deep-linkable and
 * reachable from ⌘K and voice (`client/src/AGENTS.md`).
