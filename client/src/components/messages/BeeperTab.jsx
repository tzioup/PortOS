/**
 * Comms → Messages → Beeper. The page shell for the chat surface (#35).
 *
 * It owns exactly two things the surface and the settings panel must share:
 *
 *  1. **The page-level realtime subscription.** `useBeeperRealtime` pairs its
 *     own `beeper:subscribe`/`beeper:unsubscribe` per mount, and several
 *     subscribers may be live at once — `useBeeperOutbox`, reached through
 *     `BeeperChatSurface`, mounts its own instance to refetch the outbox on a
 *     `message.upserted` invalidation (`client/src/hooks/README.md` sanctions
 *     this). This is the ONE that owns the status card: its liveness snapshot
 *     plus an invalidation counter (and the frames behind it, for
 *     `BeeperChatSurface`'s own frame-scoped thread refetch) are handed down
 *     as props, so the settings drawer never needs a subscription of its own.
 *  2. **The settings drawer.** #30's status card is not removed by the chat
 *     surface landing — it moves behind a header action, deep-linked as
 *     `?settings=1` exactly like the iMessage ingestion drawer, so ⌘K and voice
 *     can open it and an actionable fault still has a home that is not a
 *     global banner.
 *
 * The open conversation is the route param on `/messages/beeper/:conversationId`
 * (Messages routes it as the shared `:chatKey` segment), never local state.
