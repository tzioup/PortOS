import RouteTabsHeader from '../ui/RouteTabsHeader';

// Shared sub-nav for the top-level Models section.
//
// Model management used to be one long Settings tab: memory residency, measured
// assessments, backend install/switch, the llama.cpp launcher, and the install
// catalog all stacked on `/settings/local-llm`. Splitting them across their own
// section gives each a URL you can land on (and reach from ⌘K / voice) instead
// of a scroll position on a page about something else.
//
// The section now covers every KIND of model this install manages, not just
// text (#4728): image/video checkpoints, LoRAs and their training datasets,
// embedding models, and the on-device image-to-3D runtimes moved in from Create,
// Settings and Dev Tools. What stayed behind is output, not weights — Three.js
// Models is a gallery of generated meshes, and `/3d` is the render flow that
// consumes the runtimes listed here.
//
// Playground keeps its own `/local-llm/playground` path — it predates this
// section and the path is in ⌘K history — but it renders this header too, so
// selecting it does not strand the user outside the tab bar.
//
// Keep this list alphabetical by label, matching the sidebar convention.
// RouteTabsHeader collapses a list this long to a `<select>` under `sm` on its
// own — no per-section flag to remember.
