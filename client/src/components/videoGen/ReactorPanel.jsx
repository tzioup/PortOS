/**
 * reactor.inc fast-h3 render controls.
 *
 * Presentational — every value is owned by the VideoGen page. Two of the three
 * fields exist because fast-h3's contract is narrower than a free-text box can
 * express:
 *
 * - **Continue from clip** picks a clip id off a PREVIOUS reactor render (the
 *   id is stamped on its history record) and chains this one onto it with
 *   `continue_from_clip_id`. Typing an id was the old shape, and there was no
 *   way for a user to know one; it is exclusive with a starting image, since
 *   both say "begin from this picture".
 * - **Clip length** offers only lengths fast-h3 renders (see
 *   `lib/reactorVideoClip.js`) — the accepted range neither starts nor ends on
 *   a round number, so a number box mostly offered a way to type a rejected one.
 * - **Canvas** is fast-h3's resolution control, and it is an ASPECT rather than
 *   a width/height pair: every canvas holds a 768px short edge, so the aspect
 *   string is the whole choice. Auto is the default because reactor FITS a
 *   starting frame to whatever canvas the session opened with — pinning 16:9,
 *   as every render did before, is what turned a portrait input into a clip
 *   with clean audio and nothing worth watching.

        Renders on reactor.inc&apos;s fast-h3 API — near-realtime, and every finished clip can be

        continuable, so an older one may come back rejected. Counts against your reactor.inc balance.
