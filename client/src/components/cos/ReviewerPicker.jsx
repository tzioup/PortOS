/**
 * Ordered multi-reviewer picker, rendered as one row per reviewer with the five
 * per-reviewer controls as columns: **Provider | Model | Effort | Optional | Max
 * Iterations** (#3133). Click a reviewer in the Add row to append it (run order =
 * click order), reorder with the arrows, remove with ✕. Maps to slashdo's
 * `--review-with a,b,c` plus the stop-mode / `--reviewer-applies` flags.
 *
 * A second "GitHub reviewers" table collects arbitrary usernames (e.g.
 * `@CodeReviewbot`) requested as PR reviewers to gate the merge — appended to
 * `--review-with` as `@user` tokens after the keyed reviewers. Those rows have no
 * Model cell: a username reviewer is a human or a GitHub App, not a model-taking
 * backend (slashdo rejects `@login[…]` for the same reason).
 *
 * Per-row controls, each mapping to one slashdo per-entry token feature:
 * - **Model** → the `[<model>]` selector (or, for a CLI reviewer the follow-up
 *   agent invokes directly, `<reviewer> --model <id>`). Only rendered for
 *   MODEL_SELECTABLE_REVIEWERS. The option lists are OWNED BY THE CALLER (see
 *   `modelOptions`) so this component does no fetching.
 * - **Effort** → the reviewer's reasoning-effort tier, emitted as slashdo's
 *   `~effort=<level>` entry suffix and, where PortOS spells the invocation out
 *   itself, as the flag that CLI actually takes: `claude --effort high` /
 *   `codex -c model_reasoning_effort=high`, `"effort"` in the
 *   `/api/code-review/local` body for a local reviewer, and — for `cursor`,
 *   whose CLI has no `--effort` flag at all — folded into the model id as
 *   Cursor's own variant syntax (`--model gpt-5[effort=max]`), which needs the
 *   row's Model cell filled in to have anything to attach to. Only rendered for
 *   EFFORT_SELECTABLE_REVIEWERS, and each row offers only the levels its own CLI
 *   accepts (`agy` rejects `--effort max`).
 * - **Optional** → the `~opt` non-blocking marker.
 * - **Max Iterations** → the numeric `~max=<n>` round cap (blank = slashdo's
 *   built-in default, `0` = loop until clean).
 *
 * Controlled: emits the next shape via onChange so the parent can store
 * `reviewers` / `usernames` / `optionalReviewers` / `reviewerModels` /
 * `reviewerEfforts` / `reviewerMaxRounds` / `reviewStopMode` / `reviewerApplies`
 * however it persists them.
 *
 * `defaults` is the resolved fallback the parent seeded the props from (the
 * install-wide Code Review Defaults, as token-keyed maps for the pins). When
 * provided, `emit()` OMITS any key whose value is deep-equal to
 * `defaults[key]` — a field the user never touched stays absent from the
 * payload, which is exactly what `resolveReviewerConfig` reads as "inherit".
 * Without it the picker would freeze the defaults-of-that-moment into a
 * permanent task override on first touch (#6208). Omit the prop where a full
 * emit is correct — the surface that edits the defaults themselves has no
 * fallback to inherit from.
 *
 * Absent keeps meaning inherit and an explicitly-empty value keeps meaning
 * "clear": the comparison is against the resolved default, never against
 * emptiness, so `{}` / `[]` equal only a matching default and are otherwise
 * emitted as a real override that clears it. (One key is exempt: the server
 * drops an empty `reviewers` list before persisting, so `reviewers: []`
 * resolves to the default chain either way — pre-existing server behavior.)
 *
 * Known trade-off: the diff is against the CURRENT default, so an override
 * that happens to equal it (e.g. set before the default changed to match) is
 * indistinguishable from "never touched" and reverts to inherit the next time
 * any other field is edited. The effective reviewers are unchanged at that
 * moment — the pin only stops shadowing future default changes.
 *
 * `modelOptions` is the resolved model-picker data, shaped like
 * `useReviewerModelOptions()`'s return: `{ optionsByReviewer, defaultModels,
 * freeText, unavailable, providerDisabled, loaded }`. Callers keep owning their
 * own `api.getLocalLlmStatus` / `api.getProviders` fetches (that's what the hook
 * is for) — passing nothing degrades every Model cell to a free-text input, which
 * is still fully usable, rather than hiding the column.
 *
 * `showRunFlags={false}` hides the stop-mode select and the "reviewer applies
 * fixes" checkbox for surfaces that can't honor them — the `/do:next` claim
 * flows substitute a reviewer CSV into their prompt and have no slashdo flag
 * string, so rendering those two controls there would be a knob wired to
 * nothing. The reviewer list itself still applies.
 *
 * `installed` is a per-reviewer-slug install probe from the Code Review
 * Defaults endpoint (`GET /api/code-review/defaults`'s `installed` field,
 * #3606) — `{ claude: true, antigravity: false, ... }`. Only an explicit
 * `false` counts as missing; `undefined` (not a CLI reviewer, or the caller
 * didn't fetch it) says nothing.
 *
 * Together with `modelOptions.providerDisabled`, that decides which reviewers
 * the **Add** row offers up front: one whose CLI is missing here, or whose
 * provider records are all switched off, is folded behind a `+N unavailable`
 * toggle. Warn-only either way — the toggle reveals them with a badge and they
 * stay selectable, and an ALREADY-SELECTED reviewer always renders its row
 * (badged), since both checks are local-machine-only and the reviewer list is
 * federation-wide config a peer may satisfy.

  //   isn't installed.
  // - A CLI reviewer's catalog is a stored snapshot, and an Ollama-backed
  //   `claude` or a Bedrock-form id can be anything the environment provides, so
  //   its select carries a trailing "Custom…" entry that swaps the cell for a
  //   free-text input (with the same ids offered as a `<datalist>`). Clearing
  //   that input returns the cell to the dropdown. A CLI reviewer whose catalog
  //   resolved EMPTY (grok/kimi/opencode ship only a configured-default sentinel)
  //   starts in the free-text form directly — a select of nothing is a dead
  //   control — and so does a row already pinned to an id outside the catalog, so
  //   that pin stays editable rather than reading as an unpickable oddity.
  //
  // `loaded` gates the "nothing installed" messaging so a pre-fetch render
  // doesn't accuse a healthy backend of being empty.
