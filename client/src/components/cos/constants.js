// ships 14 clips: Idle, Walking, Running, Dance, Death, Sitting, Standing,
// Jump, Yes, No, Wave, Punch, ThumbsUp, WalkJump.
//
// ONE map drives every state: `state → [{ clip, timeScale, loop }]`, an ordered
// list of steps. `loop` is
//   'infinite'   — loop the clip forever (never fires the mixer's `finished`)
//   'once'       — a single LoopOnce clamped on its final frame (a pose or
//                  transition clip like `Sitting`, held instead of looping)
//   { reps: N }  — a finite LoopRepeat of N cycles; `finished` then advances to
//                  the next step, wrapping around
//
// A length-1 list is a plain base loop. A longer list is a montage — `coding`
// cycles jab → sprint → leap → approve → stride → celebrate so a working agent
// reads as energetic and varied rather than one clip on repeat. THE FIRST STEP
// IS ALSO THE STATE'S FALLBACK: when the loaded GLB resolves fewer than two
// steps, `resolveMuseMotion` collapses the list to its first resolvable step and
// loops that — so "the montage degrades to its base clip" is structural, not a
// convention two maps had to agree on.
//
// Steps name real GLB clips. Walking / Running / WalkJump carry root
// translation (they move the model forward) and would drift a fixed-frame
// avatar out of view, so `resolveMuseMotion` auto-routes them to the
// neutralized in-place variants the avatar synthesizes at load time. A step's
// FIRST entry must still be an in-place clip (it is the fallback loop, played
// as named); the constants test asserts that.
//
// Consumed by MuseCoSAvatar's AnimationMixer (via drei useAnimations). Clip
// names are matched case-sensitively against the loaded GLB: unresolvable steps
// are dropped, a state with none left falls back to MUSE_ANIMATION_FALLBACK,
// and a GLB with NO clips at all falls back to the fully-procedural
// rotation/glow behavior so static models and other variants keep working.
//
// The emote clips (Yes/No/Wave/Punch/ThumbsUp) start and end near a neutral
// pose, so looping them reads as a repeated, deliberate gesture (nodding,
// scanning, jabbing) rather than snapping — that's what lets us give each state
// its own body language instead of collapsing everything onto Idle. The read
// for each: sleeping = seated rest; thinking = calm contemplation (Idle);
// coding = an energetic work montage; investigating = slow side-to-side scan
// (No); reviewing = approving nod (Yes); planning = confident "locked in"
// thumbs-up (ThumbsUp); ideating = creative celebration (Dance).
