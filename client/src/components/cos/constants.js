// Intentional category-color enum (#1909/#1924 caution), NOT off-token theme
// inconsistency: 9 files (CoSCharacter, CyberCoSAvatar, EsotericCoSAvatar,
// MiniCharacterCoSAvatar, MuseCoSAvatar, NexusCoSAvatar, SigilCoSAvatar,
// StateLabel, TerminalCoSPanel) key their glow/fill/border color off `color`
// so all 7 agent states stay visually distinguishable at a glance. The app
// only has ~4-5 semantic tokens (accent/accent-2/success/warning/error) —
// collapsing 7 states onto them would make at least 2-3 states render
// identically, destroying the thing this enum exists for. Left as raw hex.
//
// Known issue (flagged on #1909 by codex review of PR #1935): `thinking`'s
// amber (#f59e0b) has poor contrast (~2.1:1) against light day-theme surfaces
// (e.g. Classic Noon) in the 2 consumers whose background is theme-aware
// (StateLabel's border, TerminalCoSPanel's ASCII art over --port-terminal-bg);
// against near-black surfaces (the default theme, and the fixed-dark 3D/SVG
// canvases the other 7 consumers render on) it's ~9.8:1, so the bug is
// day-theme-specific. A full per-theme-mode color swap was evaluated and
// deferred: 6 of the 9 consumers feed this value straight into three.js
// `<meshStandardMaterial color={...}>` props, which cannot resolve CSS custom
// properties (`var(--port-mood-thinking)`) — parity would need a resolved-hex
// lookup (via `getComputedStyle`) threaded through every 3D avatar, not just a
// CSS variable swap. See the follow-up discussion on #1909 for the scoped fix.

// Cyber Muse (3D) avatar motion map. The bundled default model

// ships 14 clips: Idle, Walking, Running, Dance, Death, Sitting, Standing,
// Jump, Yes, No, Wave, Punch, ThumbsUp, WalkJump.
//
// ONE map drives every state: `state → [{ clip, timeScale, loop }]`, an ordered
// list of steps. `loop` is
//   'infinite'   — loop the clip forever (never fires the mixer's `finished`)
//   'once'       — a single LoopOnce clamped on its final frame (a pose or
//                  transition clip like `Sitting`, held instead of looping)
//   { reps: N }  — a finite LoopRepeat of N cycles; `finished` then advances to
//                  the next step, wrapping around
//
// A length-1 list is a plain base loop. A longer list is a montage — `coding`
// cycles jab → sprint → leap → approve → stride → celebrate so a working agent
// reads as energetic and varied rather than one clip on repeat. THE FIRST STEP
// IS ALSO THE STATE'S FALLBACK: when the loaded GLB resolves fewer than two
// steps, `resolveMuseMotion` collapses the list to its first resolvable step and
// loops that — so "the montage degrades to its base clip" is structural, not a
// convention two maps had to agree on.
//
// Steps name real GLB clips. Walking / Running / WalkJump carry root
// translation (they move the model forward) and would drift a fixed-frame
// avatar out of view, so `resolveMuseMotion` auto-routes them to the
// neutralized in-place variants the avatar synthesizes at load time. A step's
// FIRST entry must still be an in-place clip (it is the fallback loop, played
// as named); the constants test asserts that.
//
// Consumed by MuseCoSAvatar's AnimationMixer (via drei useAnimations). Clip
// names are matched case-sensitively against the loaded GLB: unresolvable steps
// are dropped, a state with none left falls back to MUSE_ANIMATION_FALLBACK,
// and a GLB with NO clips at all falls back to the fully-procedural
// rotation/glow behavior so static models and other variants keep working.
//
// The emote clips (Yes/No/Wave/Punch/ThumbsUp) start and end near a neutral
// pose, so looping them reads as a repeated, deliberate gesture (nodding,
// scanning, jabbing) rather than snapping — that's what lets us give each state
// its own body language instead of collapsing everything onto Idle. The read
// for each: sleeping = seated rest; thinking = calm contemplation (Idle);
// coding = an energetic work montage; investigating = slow side-to-side scan
// (No); reviewing = approving nod (Yes); planning = confident "locked in"
// thumbs-up (ThumbsUp); ideating = creative celebration (Dance).

// (MUSE_SPEAKING_GESTURE) that hands control back to the current step when it
// finishes.
