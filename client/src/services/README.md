# client/src/services/ — HTTP, sockets, and browser-facing clients

API wrappers, Socket.IO client, and browser-facing clients (voice, DOM, UI dispatch).
**Before adding a new HTTP call inline, grep this catalog first** — almost every backend
domain already has a service file.

`api.js` is a barrel that re-exports everything from the `apiX.js` files; callers can
either `import * as api from '.../services/api'` or `import { specificFn } from '.../services/apiX'`.

This directory has no `index.js` barrel because every file already follows the `apiX.js`
naming convention, and `api.js` already aggregates them. When you add a new `apiX.js`,
add it to `api.js` and add a row here. `index.test.js` fails if either side drifts
(or if a non-api helper is added without a README row).

## Discovery rule

```
grep -i "what you want to do" client/src/services/README.md
```

The `request()` helper in `apiCore.js` toasts errors by default. Pass `{ silent: true }`
when the caller owns its own error UI (custom catch + toast, or `useAsyncAction` which
toasts on throw). **Custom catch ⇒ `silent: true`** — otherwise toasts fire twice.

## Core / infrastructure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `api.js` | Barrel — re-exports every `apiX.js`. |
| `apiCore.js` | `request()` helper + stable PortOS-app id. Shared error / toast handling. |
| `apiBatch.js` | `fetchByIds(path, ids, options)` — batch-fetch records through a list route's `?ids=a,b,c` filter (dedupe, empty-list short-circuit, `{ items }` envelope unwrap). |
| `socket.js` | Singleton Socket.IO client over relative path (Tailscale-friendly). |
| `appUrls.js` | Compute candidate launch URLs for an app from page context. |

## App lifecycle / system

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `apiApps.js` | App CRUD + PM2 ops (start/stop/restart) + local open actions (editor, folder, Xcode) + `getAppIssues` (open GitHub/GitLab issues for the Issues tab). |
| `apiWorkspaceContexts.js` | Per-project working-context save/restore (branch, shells, tasks). |
| `apiAccounts.js` | Platform accounts. |
| `apiAgents.js` | Running-agent process management, CoS run-event diagnostics, and persistent-mind conversation, lifecycle, context, and runtime-telemetry calls. |
| `apiCommands.js` | CLI command dispatch. |
| `apiDashboard.js` | Dashboard state. |
| `apiDatabase.js` | Database introspection. |
| `apiLocalLlm.js` | Local LLM backends (Ollama / LM Studio): status (incl. installed models), catalog, model install/delete, the managed Prompt Guard model-abuse classifier lifecycle, backend install (Homebrew/script), switch/migrate, playground test/compare, and measured per-model assessments (run + persisted results + intent ranking + the server-side "measure everything" sweep). Also the PM2-managed runtime servers (llama.cpp, MTPLX, Slotstream) and MTPLX's checkpoint catalog — `searchMtplxModels` / `pullMtplxModel` / `removeMtplxModel`, so weights are managed in-app rather than from a terminal. |
| `apiGit.js` | Git operations. |
| `apiGithub.js` | GitHub repo metadata. |
| `apiHistory.js` | Historical logs / runs. |
| `apiLogs.js` | PM2 system logs: fetch a process's recent log tail (process list comes from `apiCommands.getProcessesList`). |
| `apiPorts.js` | Port scan/detect wrappers (no current UI callers; module kept for the catalog). |
| `apiProviders.js` | AI provider configuration, plus provider-runtime (CLI) install readiness for the per-card Install buttons, and the Codex / ChatGPT-subscription account calls (`getCodexAccount`, `startCodexLogin`, `cancelCodexLogin`, `codexLogout`) — sign-in STATE only, never a token. |
| `apiPrompts.js` | Prompt Manager: stage templates, variables, and job-skill templates (providers list reuses `apiProviders.getProviders`). |
| `apiReferenceRepos.js` | Per-app reference-repo registry. |
| `apiReview.js` | Review hub. |
| `apiCodeReview.js` | Code Review Defaults (Review Loop reviewer chain + per-backend local-LLM model). |

| `apiCatalogTypes.js` | User-defined catalog ingredient types (list active registry + create/update/delete user types). |
| `apiRuns.js` | Agent run history. |
| `apiScaffold.js` | App scaffolding templates. |
| `apiSchedules.js` | Automation schedules. |
| `apiQuotaBurn.js` | Quota Burn plan + live status, the job-type catalog its config form renders, and manual runs (`getQuotaBurn`/`getQuotaBurnCatalog`/`saveQuotaBurn`/`runQuotaBurn`), plus `rearmQuotaBurn` to put spent `run once` steps back into the rotation. |
| `apiRapidReader.js` | Rapid Reader's optional author-hosted Accelerando loader and machine-local shelf API. |
| `apiSystem.js` | System info (CPU/memory/ports/alerts/active processing and local hardware capabilities) + D&D-style character sheet getter, plus the usage cost report and explicit historical reconciliation (`getUsage`, `getProviderUsage`, `getUsageBackfillStatus`/`startUsageBackfill`, `updateSubscriptionCosts` for the subscription-vs-API savings comparison, `updateUsageFleetBilling` to exclude an API-billed federated instance from Across Instances totals). Also `getCredentialInventory` (`GET /settings/credentials`) — presence and source of each PortOS credential, never a value. |
| `apiAuth.js` | Optional login password — status, login, set/clear password. |
| `apiLoops.js` | Scheduled loops. |
