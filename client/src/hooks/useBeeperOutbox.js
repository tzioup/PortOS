/**
 * The Beeper composer's send lifecycle (#36, decided on #8).
 *
 * Two server steps, deliberately: `POST /api/beeper/outbox` writes the durable
 * row from the typed body, then `POST /api/beeper/outbox/:id/send` performs the
 * send. This hook drives both from one `submit(body)` so the composer stays a
 * text box with a button, while the row exists on disk before anything is sent.
 *
 * Three rules it exists to keep:
 *
 *  - **A send that touched the wire never retries in place.** Beeper has no
 *    idempotency key on send, so retrying an attempt that reached
 *    `sendMessage` is a second real message. A `failed` row stays failed and
 *    visible in `entries`; sending again means composing again, via
 *    `submit()`, which creates a NEW row. `retry()` is the narrow exception:
 *    it only ever re-dispatches a row still `approved` — refused before the
 *    server could claim it (`OUTBOX_BREAKER_OPEN` is the practical case) —
 *    where nothing has touched the wire yet, so re-sending the same row is
 *    exactly as safe as sending it the first time.
 *  - **First contact confirms inline.** The server refuses the first outbound
 *    message to a conversation with `FIRST_CONTACT_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`;
 *    that answer is surfaced as `confirmation`, NOT as an error toast, so the
 *    composer can render an `InlineConfirmRow` (never `window.confirm`, which
 *    client conventions forbid). `confirmAndSend()` re-sends the SAME row with
 *    the flag — it does not create a second one.
 *  - **Confirmation is the server's business.** A sent row sits in
 *    `awaiting-confirmation` until the socket or the 30s fallback resolves it;
 *    this hook just refetches when an invalidation says the mirror moved.
 *
 * @param {string|null} conversationId the open conversation (a route param).
 * @param {object} [options]
 * @param {() => void} [options.onSent] called after a send is accepted, so the
 *   composer can clear its draft buffer.
