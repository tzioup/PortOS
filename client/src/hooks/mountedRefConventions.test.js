/**
 * Repo-wide guard: `hooks/useMounted.js` is the only mounted-guard ref.
 *
 * Two rules, one bug class.
 *
 * ## 1. A mounted-guard ref must re-arm itself on mount
 *
 * The broken shape is a ref seeded `useRef(true)` whose ONLY assignment is
 * `false` in an effect cleanup:
 *
 *   const mountedRef = useRef(true);
 *   useEffect(() => () => { mountedRef.current = false; }, []);   // ← no setup body
 *
 * It reads as correct, and it is — in production. But the app runs under
 * `React.StrictMode` (`client/src/main.jsx`), and React's dev build mounts every
 * component as setup → cleanup → setup on the SAME instance. Refs survive that
 * cycle, so the cleanup flips the flag to `false` and nothing ever flips it back:
 * every `if (mountedRef.current) setX(...)` in the component is dead for the rest
 * of the dev session. That shipped as two user-visible freezes — MusicGenPanel
 * stuck on "Loading generators…" forever, and every `useAsyncAction` button stuck
 * in its disabled/spinner state after one click (#3264).
 *
 * The rule is deliberately shape-based rather than name-based — a ref called
 * `editorMountedRef` carries the identical bug, and one of the sites this guard
 * was written for was named exactly that.
 *
 * ## 2. Nothing may hand-roll the guard at all, even correctly
 *
 * `#3264` fixed fourteen sites that hand-rolled the guard *wrong*; thirteen more
 * hand-rolled it *right* and were therefore invisible to rule 1. Those thirteen
 * were the supply line: copying one of them and dropping the setup line
 * reproduces #3264 exactly, and several carried multi-line comments re-deriving
 * the StrictMode hazard from first principles — evidence the hazard was being
 * rediscovered per site instead of read off the hook name. So rule 2 rejects the
 * correct hand-roll too (#3266), leaving `useMounted()` as the only spelling.
 *
 * Rule 2 keys on the *behavior* — one effect that raises a `useRef(true)` and then
 * lowers it — not on the hook's characters. A rule that matched the body verbatim
 * would be defeated by any re-spelling (`||=`, a concise cleanup arrow, a non-empty
 * dep array, a `clearTimeout` next to the flag), and the last of those is exactly
 * the form `Ask.jsx` and `ReactionTimeRunner` were in before #3266. The fix there
 * is the general one: the real cleanup moves to its own effect, and only the ref
 * bookkeeping becomes `useMounted()`.
 *
 * ## What this guard CANNOT see
 *
 * It is a source grep, not a scope-aware AST pass, so these semantically identical
 * shapes slip through. They are listed so the next person extending it knows where
 * the floor is rather than trusting a green run too far:
 *
 *   - `let`/`var` declarations (the pattern hardcodes `const`).
 *   - A non-literal seed: `const INIT = true; const r = useRef(INIT)`.
 *   - Two components in ONE file where A is correct and B is broken — rule 1's scan
 *     is file-scoped, so A's `= true` satisfies B. (Rule 2 is per-effect, so A's
 *     effect can't vouch for B's.)
 *   - A ref created in one file and lowered in another (a hook returning its ref to
 *     a caller that writes `ref.current = false`).
 *   - Aliasing (`const g = mountedRef; g.current = false`), computed access
 *     (`ref['current']`), or assignment funneled through a setter function.
 *   - Anything lexical. There is no comment/string/regex-literal stripping, so an
 *     assignment written only inside a comment counts, and — the other direction —
 *     an unbalanced `(` or `)` inside a string, comment, or regex literal skews
 *     rule 2's paren walk and can truncate the effect it was reading. Both are
 *     pinned by fixtures below so the boundary is executable rather than a claim.
 *   - Rule 2 requires the raise and the lower in the SAME `useEffect` call. Split
 *     across two effects, or funneled through a helper the effect calls, it reads
 *     as ordinary ref use and only rule 1 applies.
 *
 * Tightening any of these means moving to an AST pass; the shapes above are all
 * unusual enough in this codebase that the grep earns its keep as-is.
