/**
 * Every provider record that fronts a reviewer's binary, as predicates in
 * PREFERENCE ORDER. Two reductions run over each list and they answer different
 * questions:
 *
 * - the **option list** unions every matching record's catalog, because a
 *   reviewer runs one binary and any record fronting that binary lists ids that
 *   binary accepts. Sourcing from a single record made the picker hostage to
 *   that record's staleness — `claude-code` (CLI) listing `claude-sonnet-4-6`
 *   while `claude-code-tui` already listed `claude-sonnet-5` showed the reviewer
 *   the retired tier and hid the current one.
 * - the **shown default** takes the FIRST match, so a reviewer spawned
 *   non-interactively reports the CLI record's default rather than the TUI's.
 *
 * A predicate rather than a bare id wherever the app already recognizes a
 * provider by more than its shipped id (an `agy` configured by path), so this
 * classifies the same records the rest of the UI does.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT matched matters as much as what is:
 * - **No Bedrock/Vertex record.** `claude-code-bedrock` lists
 *   `us.anthropic.*` ids that resolve only under that record's own environment.
 * - **No `opencode-<local-backend>` preset.** Those enumerate ids that resolve
 *   only under the `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` a PortOS-spawned provider injects,
 *   and the reviewer runs a bare `opencode` against the user's OWN config. The
 *   Zen CLI/TUI records are the exception and ARE matched: their ids are the
 *   namespaced `opencode/*` spellings that bare `opencode models` prints, and
 *   the Harnesses page's model refresh fills them from exactly that probe (see
 *   `server/services/harnesses.js#usesHarnessCatalog`), so they are the live
 *   catalog for the account the reviewer will bill.
 * - **Not `opencode-zen` itself.** That is the HTTP-API record; its bare ids
 *   (`claude-opus-5`) are Zen's API model names, which `opencode -m` cannot
 *   resolve.

/**
 * Selectable model ids per model-taking reviewer, for `ReviewerPicker`'s Model
 * column. One hook so all four picker surfaces (Code Review Defaults, TaskAddForm,
 * ScheduleTab, SlashDoRunDrawer) offer the SAME options instead of only the
 * settings panel having them (#3133).
 *
 * Two sources, because the two reviewer kinds are different things:
 * - `lmstudio` / `ollama` ids come from `/api/local-llm/status`, so they reflect
 *   what's actually installed rather than a provider's stale stored `models`.
 * - Every other reviewer's tiers come from the provider catalog
 *   (`/api/providers`), unioned across the records listed in
 *   `REVIEWER_PROVIDER_MATCHERS`. That includes `mtplx`: its installed
 *   checkpoints live behind `/api/local-llm/mtplx/status`, which INVOKES the
 *   `mtplx` wrapper (a several-hundred-MB venv bootstrap on a cold version — see
 *   `server/lib/mtplxRuntime.js`), and a picker mount must never pay that. The
 *   shipped provider's catalog plus a free-text field is the honest trade.
 *
 * The `claude` list spans BOTH usage modes: the `claude-code`/`claude-code-tui`
 * provider tiers and the installed Ollama ids (an Ollama-backed `claude` CLI,
 * where `--model` selects the local model). Deduped, order-preserving.
 *
 * `freeText` marks a reviewer whose picker must ALSO accept a typed id, not only
 * a pick: an Ollama-backed `claude` can run any locally-installed id, and a
 * Bedrock/Vertex install needs its environment's own id form, neither of which a
 * catalog can enumerate. Those still render a dropdown of the catalog — the flag
 * adds a "Custom…" escape to it (see `ReviewerPicker`'s Model cell); a reviewer
 * marked `false` gets a closed list, because its options came from a live probe.
 *
 * `unavailable` distinguishes "backend is down" from "backend has no models" so
 * the empty state can say the useful thing. Absent = not probed (every reviewer
 * outside PROBED_LOCAL_BACKENDS, `mtplx` included).
 *
 * `providerDisabled[reviewer]` is true when the reviewer HAS provider records on
 * this install and every one of them is switched off — the signal
 * `ReviewerPicker` uses to drop it from the Add row, so a machine that never
 * enabled Kimi or Cursor isn't offered them. Only ever true from a landed fetch:
 * a null/failed `/api/providers` matches no record, which reads as "nothing
 * known", never as "switched off".
 *
 * `loaded` flips once both fetches settle, so a consumer can tell "no options
 * yet" from "genuinely no options" (an empty list is a real answer, not a
 * pre-fetch placeholder).
 *
 * `modelEffortLevels(reviewer, model)` narrows a reviewer's effort ladder by its
 * PINNED MODEL, because `agy` validates the model/effort PAIR (`gemini-3.1-pro`
 * has no `medium` tier) — see #3733. Only `antigravity` narrows today; every other
 * reviewer returns its static ladder. Lives here rather than in the picker so the
 * picker keeps doing no fetching of its own.
 *
