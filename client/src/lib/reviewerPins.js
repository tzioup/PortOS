/**
 * Client mirrors of the per-reviewer PIN vocabularies in
 * `server/lib/cosValidation.js` — which reviewers can carry a model or an effort
 * pin, and which values each one accepts.
 *
 * **Why these live in a leaf module rather than in `components/cos/constants.js`.**
 * The server suite pins this mirror against the server's own derived ladders (see
 * the `client mirror of the reviewer effort ladders` test in
 * `server/lib/cosValidation.test.js`) — a level offered here but rejected there
 * would show the user a pin that silently never persists, and the reverse would
 * hide a tier their CLI accepts. That test runs in the SERVER workspace, which has
 * no client dependencies installed, so anything it imports must not reach for one.
 * `components/cos/constants.js` imports `lucide-react` for its tab/state icons, so
 * importing the mirror from there fails CI with `Cannot find package
 * 'lucide-react'` even though the icons have nothing to do with reviewer pins.
 * Keeping the mirror in a dependency-free leaf lets the drift gate import it.
 *
 * `constants.js` re-exports every name here, so existing client imports are
 * unaffected.
