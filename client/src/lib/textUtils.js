/**
 * Pure prose helpers, from the module that owns them on both sides.

 * `escapeRegExp` and `countWords` are named re-exports of
 * `server/lib/textUtils.js` — imported rather than copied so the two runtimes
 * cannot drift: the word count the Writers Room and autobiography editors show
 * beside a draft is the same `\S+` rule the server stores for it. Named rather
 * than `export *` so this file stays the list of what the browser bundle has a
 * caller for; the file itself stays so every `lib/textUtils` import path in the
 * client is unchanged.
