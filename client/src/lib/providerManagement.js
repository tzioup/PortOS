 *   - which saved model pins the current subset no longer covers.
 *

 * redact — but nothing here may start inventing identity either: two
 * connections are the same only when the server says they share an id.

 *
 * Two normalizations, both deliberate:
 *
 *   - a blank text field is `null` (unpinned), never `''`. The server reads an
 *     empty pin as unset too, so treating them as different values would make
 *     every form dirty on open.
 *   - a blank `timeout` is NO CHANGE rather than a clear. The executable
