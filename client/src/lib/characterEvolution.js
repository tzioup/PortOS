/**
 * The five-stage character evolution lens as the editors consume it (#6440).
 *
 * Re-exports the vocabularies from the pure server leaf
 * `server/lib/characterEvolution.js` — imported rather than copied so the two
 * runtimes cannot drift — and adds the editor-only descriptors (label,
 * placeholder, per-field cap) the arc and FableLoom plan editors render.
 * Exactly how `client/src/lib/characterFramework.js` mirrors
 * `server/lib/characterFramework.js`; a guard in
 * `server/lib/characterEvolution.test.js` fails if this file ever restates a
 * vocabulary instead of re-exporting it.
 *
 * The lens is OPTIONAL everywhere it appears: an editor renders it unset by
 * default, and clearing every field is a real clear that sanitizes the whole
 * lens back to absent.
