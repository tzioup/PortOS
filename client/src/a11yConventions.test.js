/**
 * Repo-wide accessibility conventions.
 *
 * These encode the regressions that keep reappearing across a11y audit passes,
 * so a new component fails the suite instead of shipping the gap:
 *
 *   1. A hand-rolled `fixed inset-0 … bg-black/N` overlay instead of the shared
 *      `ui/Modal`, which owns the focus trap, the Esc stack, `role="dialog"`,
 *      and focus restore. A hand-rolled backdrop is click-to-dismiss only — a
 *      keyboard user has no way out and tabs straight through to the page
 *      behind it.
 *   2. A toggle-switch-shaped `<button>` (a pill track with a sliding knob)
 *      that never says it is a switch, so assistive tech announces "button"
 *      with no on/off state. `components/ToggleSwitch.jsx` is the shared
 *      widget; hand-rolled tracks must at least carry `role="switch"` +
 *      `aria-checked`.
 *   3. A `<input type="file">` hidden with `hidden`/`aria-hidden`/`tabIndex={-1}`
 *      and driven by a programmatic `ref.current.click()`. That is unreachable
 *      by keyboard and screen reader, and the synthetic click doesn't open the
 *      picker at all in WebKit-as-installed-PWA — the shape PortOS is opened in
 *      from a second machine over the tailnet. `components/ui/FilePickerButton.jsx`
 *      is the shared widget (sr-only input + native `<label for>` activation).
 *   4. A `duration: Infinity` toast whose content is JSX or a render prop but
 *      which passes no `label`. Such a toast collapses to a pill after
 *      COLLAPSE_AFTER_MS (so it stops covering the page), and the pill has no
 *      text of its own to name itself with.
 *   5. A non-interactive element (`<div>`, `<li>`, `<tr>`, …) carrying an
 *      `onClick` and nothing else. It takes no focus and Enter/Space do
 *      nothing, so the affordance does not exist at all for a keyboard or
 *      screen-reader user. `lib/a11yKeyboard.js`'s `clickableProps(handler)`
 *      supplies the missing role, tab stop and Enter/Space handler.
 *   6. An `<img>` with no `alt`, which is announced by its `src` — a hashed
 *      filename or a blob URL. `alt=""` is the correct spelling for a
 *      decorative image and passes; only the omission is the bug.
 *   7. An icon-only `<button>` sized to its bare icon (`p-1` around a
 *      12-14px glyph = a 22px target) instead of the 44px floor the rest of
 *      the app enforces.
 *
 * Scoped to git-tracked `.jsx` under `client/src` so an untracked scratch file
 * can't fail the suite.

 * A tag start is exactly a `<` that enters `jsx-tag` mode, so everything the

 * `<` it really closes rather than with whatever the innermost open tag is.
 *
 * Each entry is `{ closing, name, index, tag, contentStart, selfClosing,
 * parent, matchingClose }`. The structural links are assigned after
 * lexing, once every opener knows whether it was self-closing.
 * An unterminated tag keeps `tag: null` — the walk reports it rather than

 * which is what #4318, #4327 and #4333 all were: one scanner taught something
 * its siblings weren't. They now share this generator, which yields one token
 * per significant character together with the CONTEXT it sits in, and hands
 * back strings, comments, and regex literals as whole spans so no caller can
 * read into one by accident.
 *
 * Tokens:
 *   { kind: 'char',    index, char, mode, depth, opensTag, tagStart, selfClosing }
 *   { kind: 'string',  index, end,  mode }   — `end` is the closing quote
 *   { kind: 'comment', index, end,  mode }   — `end` is the comment's last char
 *   { kind: 'regex',   index, end,  mode }   — `end` is the closing slash
 *
 * `opensTag` marks the `<` that enters a tag — the one fact a tag walk needs
 * and the one thing no caller can decide for itself, since whether a `<` is a
 * tag or a less-than depends on the context this machine is tracking.
 * `tagStart` rides on every `jsx-tag` character and names the `<` of the tag
 * being read, so a `>` can be paired with its own opener even after an
 * attribute expression parked that tag on the brace stack.
 *
 * `mode` is where the character sits: `'code'` (a JavaScript expression),
 * `'jsx-tag'` (between a tag's `<` and the `>` that closes it), or `'jsx-text'`
 * (an element's visible body, where an apostrophe is an apostrophe and `//` is
 * two slashes). `depth` is `{…}` nesting relative to `from`, reported so that a
 * brace and its match share a depth: an opener reports the depth it opens FROM,
 * a closer the depth it leaves behind. So the `}` matching the `{` at `from` is
 * the first `}` at depth 0.

// --- the wrapper registry -------------------------------------------------
//
// A control is often named by the component that wraps it rather than by markup
// written next to it. Whether the guard sees that has two independent
// dimensions, and flattening them into ad-hoc branches left half the
// combinations unreachable (#4317):
//
//   WHERE the wrapper is declared — in this file, or imported from a relative
//   path. Resolved by `wrapperRegistry`, which reads the imported file and runs
//   the very same detectors on it.
//
//   HOW it names — proved by `wrapperShapes` from the wrapper's own source:
//     implicit  `<label …>{children}</label>` — the control is wrapped in a
//               real <label> (PipelineSeries.jsx's `<Field label="…">`), so the
//               text that <label> carries names it.
//     forwarded `<label htmlFor={idProp}>{labelProp}</label>` — the wrapper
//               renders the <label>, the call site supplies the id and text
//               (LifestyleTab.jsx's `<FieldGroup>`).
//     cloned    the wrapper generates the id and clones it onto its first React
//               child (components/ui/FormField.jsx).
//
// Every entry is earned by reading the wrapper's source, never by matching its
// name. That is what stops the registry degenerating into "any component with a
// label-ish prop exempts its input", and it is why the imported branch can be
// trusted at all: an imported `FormField` is credited because its <label> was
// read, not because it is spelled FormField.

// A component is either a `function` declaration or an arrow assigned to a
// capitalized binding. Both forms count: an arrow-shaped label wrapper names
// its control just as well, and treating it as invisible pushes new code toward
// an `aria-label` that shadows the visible label the wrapper already renders.
// A concise arrow body that is neither `{…}` nor `(…)` (`= (p) => <label…>`) is
// still skipped — there is no cheap end boundary for it, and the repo wraps
// multi-line JSX in parens.
// `[\w$]` matches `relativeImportBindings` on the other side of the import: `$`
// is a legal identifier character, and a detector that admits `Fi$ld` as an
// imported binding while this one refuses to declare it left such a wrapper
// invisible from both directions at once — which is why no fixture could
