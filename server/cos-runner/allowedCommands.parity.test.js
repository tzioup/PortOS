/**
 * Parity pin for the AI Providers editor's runner-allowlist warning (#4143).
 *
 * The client never carries its own copy of the allowlist — it receives it as
 * `runnerAllowedCommands` on `GET /api/providers`, so the list itself cannot
 * drift. What it DOES mirror is the normalization `isAllowedCommand` applies
 * before the membership test (strip directory prefix, strip a trailing
 * `.exe`), and that mirror is what this file pins.
