/**
 * Sprites Routes — REST surface for the Sprite Manager.

 * Phase 1 (#2895): library list/get, source-tree importer, record patch.
 * Phase 2 (#2896, reordered turnaround-first in #2979): character create + the

 * shared image-gen queue, review, then lock (normalize + dynamic chroma-key
 * selection). Generation is strictly user-triggered per the AI-provider policy;
 * locked artifacts are versioned and protected from overwrite; deliberate
