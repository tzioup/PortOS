/**
 * ChatGPT ZIP Import Service
 *
 * Ingests the modern multi-file ChatGPT data export (a `.zip`, streamed up
 * whole — no in-memory cap) end to end:
 *
 *   1. Stream-extract the ZIP (`parseZip`) — never decompress the whole archive
 *      into one buffer; members are handled one at a time as they arrive.
 *      - `conversations*.json` + `conversation_asset_file_names.json` are
 *        buffered in memory (small relative to the assets).
 *      - `*.dat` asset files (images / voice audio / PDFs) are **streamed
 *        straight to a temp file** in the served assets dir
 *        (`PATHS.brainImportAssets`) as they arrive — only the leading bytes are
 *        held to sniff the real extension, so peak RAM stays bounded to one chunk
 *        no matter how large the export is. After the stream closes (the
 *        asset-name map may arrive after the `.dat` members) each temp file is
 *        renamed to its final `<assetId><ext>` served name, keyed by the global
 *        asset id and falling back to the friendly name in the asset-name map
 *        for the extension when magic-byte sniffing comes up empty. `chat.html`
 *        and other bulky members are drained without buffering.
 *   2. Build a `pointer -> { url, name, mime }` resolver so transcript rendering
 *      can inline `![](url)` images and `[🔊 audio](url)` / `[📎 file](url)`
 *      links pointing at the extracted assets.
 *   3. Parse + import via the shared `chatgptImport` service, passing the
 *      resolver so every conversation's transcript embeds its assets.
 *
 * Both the legacy single-`conversations.json` JSON path (browser-parsed) and
 * this ZIP path converge on the same `parseExport`/`importConversations` — the
 * only difference is the `assetResolver`.
