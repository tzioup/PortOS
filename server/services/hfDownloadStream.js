// SSE driver for HuggingFace repo pre-download endpoints. Image gen and video
// gen both expose `GET /…/models/:id/download` (and video also a separate
// `/text-encoder/download`); without this helper each route open-codes the
// same `writeHead → send → cache-check → in-flight check → spawn → cleanup`
// flow. A single in-flight Map keyed by repo also dedupes across routes:
// FLUX-family repos referenced by both image and video gen would otherwise
// spawn two concurrent children.
//
// Lives in services rather than lib because it drives `downloadHfRepo` — a
// python child process that reads settings for its venv and HF token. The pure
// SSE plumbing it builds on (`openSseStream`, `onClientDisconnect`) stays in
// `lib/sseDownload.js` (issue #4901).

  //    when a model has auxiliary repos that must be present alongside the main
  //    weights (e.g. HiDream's separate Llama-3.1 text encoder). Sequential;
  //    short-circuits on any single-repo error.
  //  - `fallbacks` (ordered array of `{ repo, only? }`) — FIRST SUCCESS wins, and
  //    a failure advances to the next entry. Used when the same file lives in
  //    several repos with different access (Ingredients: gated first-party repo,
  //    then an un-gated mirror), so a user with no HF token still succeeds.
  //
  // `only` (array of exact repo-relative filenames, per entry) forwards to the
  // helper's single-file mode — MANDATORY for aggregate repos where a snapshot is
  // catastrophic (the ~708 GB DeepBeepMeep/LTX-2 mirror).
  //
  // `ignore` (array of fnmatch globs, per entry) is the inverse: still snapshot
  // the repo, but drop paths the runtime never loads — extra checkpoint formats
  // or a bundled sibling model. Ignored when `only` is set for the same entry.
  //
  // `cachedFile` is the "is it already here?" predicate for a single-file pull:
  // `inspectModelCache` reports the whole repo cached as soon as ANY weight is
  // resident, which for an aggregate mirror is true after the first unrelated
  // file — so the generic already-cached short-circuit would skip a weight the
  // user doesn't have. Callers pass an async `() => boolean` that checks the one
  // file instead.
