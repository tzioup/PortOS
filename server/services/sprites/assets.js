/**
 * Sprites — on-disk asset deletion (#2930 follow-up).
 *
 * As a character is iterated, its runtime/ tree accumulates old atlas versions
 * (`runtime/vN/<id>-animation-atlas-vN.png` + sidecar manifest) and its
 * reference/walk trees accumulate superseded candidate renders. This prunes
 * one asset at a time by the same record-relative `path` the listing and the
 * static route already use.
 *
 * Two things are refused: the record-state index files (the mutable atlas
 * pointer + the append-only publish history — deleting those corrupts the
 * bookkeeping that still points at surviving versions), and the atlas the
 * current pointer selects (deleting the live sheet would strand any published
 * app AND loop compileAtlas's missing-PNG self-heal). Everything else is fair
 * game. A runtime version is deleted as a unit (PNG + manifest together) — a
 * stray manifest whose PNG is gone re-seeds that self-heal path (atlas.js).
 *
 * Runs inside the record's walk write tail so a delete can never interleave
 * with an in-flight compile/approve that reads the same version tree.
