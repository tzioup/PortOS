/**
 * Sprites — walk-animation workflow orchestration (issue #2897, phase 3).
 *
 * Per-direction lifecycle on top of the locked reference set (#2896):
 * generate ONE grok image_to_video walk clip per direction (user-triggered,
 * cloud lane), then the completion hook runs the fully deterministic Node
 * postprocess (walkPostprocess.js) into a candidate run. The user reviews,
 * optionally loop-trims, and approves per direction; when all 8 directions
 * are approved the finalized walk-set manifest freezes the set.
 *
 * Disk layout (vendor-neutral runs/ tree; the provider is a run-record field):
 *   runs/walk-<direction>-<runId8>/animation-run.json + generated/…
 *   walk/<id>-walk-selection-v1.json, walk/<id>-walk-set-v1.json
 *   walk/trims/<slug>-vNNN-{strip.png,.gif,.json}
 *
 * A finalized walk set 409s generation/approval/postprocess until deliberately
 * reopened. Revising a directional anchor also removes the approval for the
 * walk conditioned on that stale anchor while preserving its rendered run.

 *
 * **`extract` is opt-in, and this read is otherwise side-effect free.** The
 * importer never copies `raw/` (its EXCLUDED_RUN_SEGMENTS skips it), so EVERY
 * imported run reaches this with an empty raw directory — exactly the population
 * the feature exists for. Extracting from the read would therefore mean opening
 * the trimmer and clicking through eight directions silently spawns eight ffmpeg
 * decodes (~96 PNGs each), each holding the per-record write tail while an
 * approve or trim queues behind it, and lands >100MB of re-derivable
 * intermediates that flow into backups — all for a panel the user may never
 * expand. So the plain read reports `raw-frames-cleaned` and the caller asks for
