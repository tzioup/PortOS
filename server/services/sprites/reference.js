/**
 * Sprites — reference workflow orchestration (issue #2896, phase 2).
 *
 * Ports the source pipeline's stage 1–2, reordered turnaround-first (#2979):
 * create a character, generate turnaround-sheet candidates (text and/or an
 * uploaded visual reference), freeze the approved sheet as the immutable
 * identity root, then derive the main (walk-south) from its front panel and
 * each of the 7 remaining directional anchors from the panel showing that
 * side. A character created before #2979 is main-first (manifest
 * `schemaVersion` 1) and backfills a sheet from its locked main before it can
 * derive further anchors. Generation rides the shared media-job queue
 * (`enqueueJob` kind:'image' with a `spriteRef` destination tag — the
 * completion hook in services/spriteReferenceImageHook.js files finished
 * renders into reference/candidates/); locking is deterministic sharp work
 * (normalize.js) plus the dynamic chroma-key selection (chromaKey.js).
 *
 * Evidence contract: a locked artifact is never overwritten. A
 * turnaround-derived directional anchor may be deliberately reopened on its
 * own; the main may be deliberately reopened while retaining its turnaround;
 * the turnaround may also be deliberately reopened together with every
 * artifact that descends from it. In every revision flow the old versioned PNG
 * stays on disk and the replacement lands at the next `-vN` filename.
