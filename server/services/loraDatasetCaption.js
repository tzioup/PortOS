/**
 * LoRA dataset captioning — vision-LLM auto-captions with SSE progress.
 *
 * Sequential loop (vision backends are local; concurrency 1) over the
 * dataset's ready images: read file → base64 data URL →
 * `describeImageDataUrl` (the same provider pathway the voice agent's
 * ui_describe_visually tool uses) → trigger-word prefix → persist. A
 * module-level mutex (`withCaptionVisionLock`) extends that concurrency-1
 * guarantee ACROSS runs, so overlapping caption runs can't fan out parallel
 * requests at a single-GPU backend (see the lock's header for why parallel
 * local vision is pure downside).
 * Progress streams over the shared per-job SSE helpers; the client
 * subscribes via `GET /api/lora-datasets/:id/caption-runs/:runId/events`
 * and refetches the dataset on the terminal frame.
 *
 * Provider/model resolution: request override → `settings.loraTraining.*`
 * → a vision-capable installed model auto-picked across the local backends.
 * A vision model is *required* — captioning sends image content blocks, so a
 * text-only model would 400 per image with a cryptic "Model does not support
 * images". We resolve (and validate) a vision model up front and fail the whole
 * run with one actionable error instead.
