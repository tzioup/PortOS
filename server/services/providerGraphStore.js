/**
 * Postgres adapter for the provider connection graph — `ai_connections`,
 * `ai_harness_bindings`, `ai_route_bindings` (#6367).
 *
 * db-primary per `docs/STORAGE.md`: app-native relational identities with real
 * foreign keys, not an externally edited file. **Machine-local — never
 * federated**: every row names this host's endpoints, credentials and execution
 * environment (ADR `docs/decisions/2026-08-08-privacy-records-machine-local.md`).
 * No `sync_sequence`, no tombstones, no `PORTOS_SCHEMA_VERSIONS` entry. Covered
 * by the normal Postgres dump in backup, like every other db-primary table.
 *
 * This module is only row I/O and revision checks. The projection engine, the
 * reconciliation policy and the serialization against legacy provider writes
 * all live in `providerGraph.js`; the pure planning lives in
 * `server/lib/providerGraphRecords.js`. Keeping the split means the interesting
 * decisions are testable without a database.
 *
 * Every write here runs inside one transaction, so a graph revision and its
 * pending projection snapshot commit together or not at all — that atomicity is
 * what makes an interrupted file write recoverable rather than ambiguous.
