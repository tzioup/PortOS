/**
 * Brain Search Index
 *
 * In-memory field projections of the brain entity stores, so unified search
 * (`server/services/search.js`) can answer a keystroke without re-reading and
 * re-parsing every record file on disk (issue #3506), and so the brain graph's
 * search index (`brainGraph.getBrainGraphSearchIndex`) can answer the graph
 * search box without a full-body disk walk (issue #3507).
 *
 * Brain entity stores are per-record `collectionStore` dirs
 * (`data/brain/<type>/<id>/index.json`) with NO whole-store cache — every
 * `brainStorage.getAll(type)` lists the directory and `loadOne`s each record.
 * That is the right trade for the write paths, but the ⌘K palette fans out to
 * seven of those stores on EVERY keystroke, so a brain of a few thousand
 * records turns each character typed into thousands of stat+read+JSON.parse
 * calls. This module reads each store at most once and then keeps the
 * projection fresh from `brainEvents`.
 *
 * Only the fields a consumer actually reads (plus the ordering key) are
 * projected — the index holds no attachments, embeddings, or classification
 * payloads. A consumer that needs a *predicate* over a large body (the Daily
 * Log's `content`/`segments`) gets a derived boolean instead, so the body never
 * enters the cache.
 *
 * FRESHNESS — three signal classes, all of them covered:
 *   1. `${type}:upserted` / `${type}:deleted` — the per-record events every
 *      local write path emits (create/update/updateWith/updateMany/remove, and
 *      upsertWithId in its default mode). Patched incrementally, no re-scan.
 *   2. `record:changed` — the local-only invalidation signal brainStorage emits
 *      from the write paths that are deliberately event-SILENT: peer applies
 *      (`applyRemoteRecord`, silent to prevent the #1077 cross-peer echo) and
 *      `upsertWithId({ emitEvent: false })`. Without it an inbound sync or
 *      anti-entropy reconcile would leave this cache stale indefinitely.
 *   3. Nothing else writes brain entity records — `pruneTombstones` only hard-
 *      prunes tombstones, which `getAll` strips and which therefore were never
 *      in the projection, and `backfillOriginInstanceId` runs once at boot and
 *      touches no projected field.

/**
 * The projected fields per indexed brain type — the union of what every

 *     from `capturedText` / `name` / `context` / `title` / `oneLiner` / `notes`
 *     / `nextAction` / `content` / `mood` / `url` / `description`.
 *   - `getBrainGraphSearchIndex` (server/services/brainGraph.js) derives each
 *     node's label from `name || title` and drops archived records, while the
 *     edge-bearing graph views also need tags, status, and summary fields.
 * `journals` is graph-only (the Daily Log is not a unified-search source), and
 * projects no body — see `journalHasBody` below. `songs` (SongBook) is
 * graph-only too, and its sheet body lives in `content.text` (up to 200k
 * chars of tab/ChordPro per song). The graph projection keeps only a string
 * `content` value, so the SongBook object never reaches the cache.
