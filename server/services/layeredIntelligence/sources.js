/**
 * THREAT MODEL — a `cmd` custom source is attacker-reachable persistent config.
 *
 * The `sources.custom` array lives in each app's stored `layeredIntelligence`
 * config, written through the validated `PUT /api/apps/:id` route. A `cmd` entry
 * is executed here on the Layered Intelligence SCHEDULE (Engine-B autonomous job),
 * with the PortOS process's own privileges and cwd = the app repo. So any path
 * that can land a string in that config (a hand-edited config, a hostile sync
 * payload, a future config-writing feature, an XSS-driven same-origin POST) gets
 * *persistent, unattended* code execution — not a one-shot the operator watched.
 *
 * Historically this ran the full command string with `shell: true`, capped only
 * by length + a 15s timeout. That is arbitrary RCE: `; rm -rf ~`, `$(curl … | sh)`,
 * pipes to `sh`, etc. all execute. Issue #2515.
 *
 * Defense: by default we DENY the shell. The command is parsed and checked by
 * `validateUnattendedCommand` (commandSecurity.js), which rejects shell
 * metacharacters (`;|&$(){}` …) and admits only the read-only inspection
 * binaries in `UNATTENDED_READONLY_COMMANDS` (`git`, `gh`, `glab`, `ls`, `cat`,
 * `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `find`, `wc`, `pwd`, `echo`); then we spawn the base
 * binary with parsed args and `shell: false` — so no shell ever interprets the
 * string. A rejected command is dropped (key omitted) with a warning, exactly
 * like any other failed source read.
 *
 * This lane deliberately does NOT use the operator-facing `validateCommand`
 * allowlist. That one admits `npx`, `node`, `python`, `pip`, `curl`, `wget`,
 * `go`, `cargo`, `make` and `brew` — every one of which fetches and/or executes
 * arbitrary code without a single shell metacharacter (`npx <pkg>`,
 * `pip install <pkg>`, `curl -o <path> <url>`), so the metacharacter filter
 * would be doing all the work here. Fine for a run a human triggered and is
 * watching; not fine for persistent config on an autonomous schedule. Issue #5669.
 *
 * Escape hatch: an operator who genuinely needs a pipeline (`git log … | head`)
 * or a binary outside the read-only list can set the install-level
 * `settings.layeredIntelligence.trustShellSources` flag, which restores the full
 * `shell: true` behavior for THIS install only. It is an explicit, install-wide
 * opt-in — off by default — so a fresh install (or a synced-in app config) can
 * never execute anything but a read-only inspection command.
 *
 * `exec` is injectable for tests; `trustShellSources` is resolved by the caller
 * (`gatherSources`) from install settings and threaded in.
 *
 * Returns null on rejection / non-zero exit / timeout / no output so a failing or
 * denied command just omits the source key rather than throwing.
