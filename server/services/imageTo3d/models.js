/**
 * Image-to-3D model orchestration (issue #2952) — gallery-image lineage, target
 * dispatch, guarded local render, persistence, and GLB export.
 *
 * This is the record/create/generate layer that sits on top of the pluggable
 * target registry (`targets.js`) and the TRELLIS.2 runner (`trellis2.js`). It
 * mirrors the role `threejsModels/index.js` plays for procedural models, but the
 * inference is a LOCAL on-device render (no AI provider) landing a real `.glb`
 * mesh on disk rather than an LLM-authored scene spec.
 *
 * The render NEVER auto-runs: it is only reached from an explicit user create /
 * generate request, and it is gated on the target being installed + runnable on
 * this host (AGENTS.md no-cold-bootstrap AI policy + the host's sensitivity to
 * sustained GPU load). Adding a second target is a registration in `adapters.js`,
 * not a rewrite here.
