// Destructive-action confirmation gate.
//
// When the voice agent fires a `ui_click` whose resolved element label looks
// destructive (delete / remove / discard / reset / clear) we don't blindly
// click — instead the tool stashes a `pendingDestructive` record on the
// session state and returns a result asking the LLM to prompt the user for
// spoken confirmation. The user's NEXT spoken turn is intercepted by the
// voice pipeline (before the LLM runs) and routed through resolvePending():
//
//   "confirm" / "yes do it" / "go ahead" → re-issue the click side-effect
//   "no" / "cancel" / "stop"             → drop the pending click and send a
//                                          short spoken acknowledgement
//                                          ("Cancelled.") without running the
//                                          LLM
//   anything else (ambiguous)            → clear the pending state and fall
//                                          through to the normal LLM turn so
//                                          the user can do something else.
//
// Keeping this as a pure module (no I/O, no socket emits; the clock is
// injectable via `createdAt` / `now` parameters and only defaults to
// `Date.now()` for ergonomics at call sites) makes the state machine
// trivially testable.

// Conservative on purpose — false-negatives only mean the user clicks a Delete
// button without an extra confirm prompt, which mirrors a normal mouse click.
// False-positives ("Reset filters" → confirm gate) are mildly annoying but
// safe. Anchored on word boundaries so labels like "Cleared" / "Resettable"
// don't trip it.

// moved on. Trailing punctuation is stripped before matching.
// Optional leading "ok/okay " filler is allowed in NEGATIVE_RE so that
// "okay cancel" / "okay never mind" are correctly classified as cancellations

// user takes a beat ("yes, … delete it"), so commas/colons/semicolons
