Plain navigation to the daily log goes through ui_navigate. ' +

Use ui_click for tabs/buttons/links, ui_fill for text inputs, ui_select for dropdowns, ui_check for checkboxes. Pass the EXACT label shown in the UI summary. Prefer the `kind` argument when you have it (tab vs button). If the label isn\'t in the current UI summary, call ui_list_interactables OR ui_navigate first — do NOT guess. Active tab is marked with * in the summary; don\'t click it again. ' +
      'FORM FILL vs CAPTURE — CRITICAL: When the user directs content INTO a visible field ("fill description with X", "type X in the name field", "put X in the body", "enter X into title", "set the subject to X"), the target is the FIELD and X is the new value. ALWAYS call ui_fill with label=<field> and value=<X>. NEVER call brain_capture or daily_log_append for these turns — even when X contains words like "remember", "note", "save", or "jot", those are field content, not a request to capture to the inbox.

Always re-read this `ui` field before choosing the next action — don\'t rely on the original per-turn UI summary after an action has fired. For multi-step flows like "create a task called Foo with description Bar": ui_click New Task → read result.ui → ui_fill Name=Foo → read result.ui → ui_fill Description=Bar → ui_click Save.

NEVER reply with just a paraphrased "add to my daily log: …" line — that\'s narration; CALL daily_log_append. ' +
