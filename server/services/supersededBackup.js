/**
 * Pre-reap backup for a SUPERSEDED branch.
 *
 * `branch-reconcile` records a SUPERSEDED verdict and then deletes the branch and
 * its worktree (see `reapSupersededBranches` in `branchReconcile.js`). That is the
 * only way the reconciler converges — a branch whose work landed on the default
 * branch under other names is never `isMerged`, so nothing else ever reaps it and
 * every recheck re-derives the same verdict at full coordinator cost.
 *
 * Deleting a worktree is irreversible, and a superseded branch's uncommitted work
 * is redundant rather than worthless — so nothing is removed until a recoverable
 * copy exists on disk. This module writes that copy, and the reap is gated on it
 * succeeding: no backup, no delete.
 *
 * Layout, one directory per branch under `data/cos/abandoned-worktree-backups/`:
 *   <slug>/manifest.json   what it was, why it was reaped, how to restore it
 *   <slug>/commits.patch   `git format-patch <default>..<branch>` (branch commits)
 *   <slug>/worktree.diff   `git diff HEAD` in its worktree (tracked edits)
 *   <slug>/untracked/…     verbatim copies of its untracked, non-ignored files
 *
 * Untracked files are COPIED rather than rendered as a `--no-index` patch: they
 * are usually the whole deliverable of an abandoned agent worktree, and a copy
 * survives binary content and needs no patch tooling to read back.
