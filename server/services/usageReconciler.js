/**
 * Replace PortOS's estimated per-run token counts with the CLI's own measured
 * counts, read from the transcripts the coding CLIs already write to disk.
 *
 * PortOS estimates output from captured stdout (a repainted ANSI screen for TUI
 * providers) and input from `promptLength` — the initial task description only,
 * which omits the per-turn context replay and prompt-cache traffic that dominate
 * real API cost. The result understated cost by orders of magnitude (#3124).
 * Claude Code and Codex both write real per-message counts locally, so the fix
 * is to read them: no provider call, no tokens spent, no network.
 *
 * Correlation has no shared identifier to work with — PortOS never captured the
 * CLI's own session id — so a run is matched to a transcript by
 * (a) working directory and (b) timestamp overlap with `[startTime, endTime]`:
 *
 *   Claude Code — the project directory name IS the slugified cwd, so the
 *     candidate set is exact; each session file is then windowed by timestamp.
 *   Codex — rollouts are filed by date, so we scan the run's date directories
 *     and keep sessions whose `session_meta.cwd` matches.
 *   Grok — sessions live under `encodeURIComponent(cwd)`, so that lookup is
 *     exact too; turns are windowed by the event stream's own timestamps.
 *   Antigravity — `history.jsonl` maps a workspace to a conversation id, and
 *     the brain transcript it names carries per-step timestamps.
 *
 * The scan is NOT limited to the run's own provider family. A CoS task that
 * ships a PR with `--review-with grok,antigravity` bash-launches those CLIs as
 * children of the parent agent: they leave a session on disk but never become a
 * PortOS run, so nothing else would ever account for that spend and the parent's
 * chars/4 estimate cannot see it. Every family's store is therefore searched in
 * the run's workspace and window, and each session is billed to ITS OWN
 * configured provider (#5831) — never folded into the parent's row.
 *
 * When nothing matches (a provider that writes no transcript, an unreadable
 * home directory, an ambiguous window) the caller falls back to the existing
 * estimate — `reconcileRunUsage` reports which happened via `source`, so the
 * report can mark measured rows apart from estimated ones. Reading a transcript
 * is best-effort by design: a failure here must never fail the run it describes.
