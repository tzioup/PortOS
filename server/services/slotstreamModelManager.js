/**
 * Slotstream weights — the one step of the runtime PortOS did not manage.
 *
 * `slotstreamServerManager.js` owns the process (install / start / stop / logs)
 * and it deliberately refuses to start without a cached checkpoint. Until this
 * module existed, the only answer it could offer was "place a checkpoint
 * directory in ~/.slotstream/models yourself" — a hand-assembled 100 GB+
 * directory, which is a dead end inside an app that manages everything else
 * about the runtime.
 *
 * A download still never happens implicitly. It moves tens of gigabytes and
 * only ever runs from a button the user pressed that names what it will fetch,
 * and a START still never fetches anything — this is its own explicit action.
 *
 * The transfer is PortOS's own resumable HTTP path (`streamResumableDownload`),
 * not a Python helper: Slotstream is a single native binary, and requiring an
 * image-gen venv for a text runtime's weights would be a strange dependency to
 * take on. Each file lands under the checkpoint directory the cache walk reads,
 * so a completed download is servable with no restart.
