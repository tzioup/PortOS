/**
 * CoS local-inference agent slots (issue #4834)
 *
 * `promptRunner`'s `withLocalConcurrencyGate` caps concurrent IN-FLIGHT calls
 * per local endpoint, but it only sees requests PortOS itself makes. A CoS TUI
 * agent runs a vendor CLI that opens its own connection to the local model
 * server — PortOS never observes that traffic, so `dequeueNextTask` could
 * dispatch two or three agents at one GPU and push it into an accelerator OOM.
 *
 * This module supplies the *avoidance* half, enforced at two altitudes:
 *
 *   - `acquireLocalEndpointSpawnSlot` is the AUTHORITATIVE cap, called from
 *     subAgentSpawner's `task:ready` listener — the one chokepoint every
 *     emitter funnels through. It reserves the slot across the spawn window so
 *     two dispatches can't both read a pre-registration snapshot and pass.
 *   - `createLocalEndpointSlotContext` feeds the pure capacity tracker in
 *     cosDequeue.js, so `dequeueNextTask` simply never emits a task that would
 *     be held — cheaper, and it logs queued-no-slot against the right task.
 *
 * Deliberately separate accounting from promptRunner's in-process gate: one
 * throttles requests PortOS makes, the other throttles agents PortOS launches.
 * A shared counter across process boundaries isn't worth the coupling.

 * here: a user who relocates their daemon with `OLLAMA_HOST` would otherwise get
 * two independent slot keys for one daemon — the exact double-booking this cap
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * It answers `null` for a provider that maps to no KNOWN local runtime, so fall
 * back to the recorded endpoint: an arbitrary local server (the shipped
 * `opencode-vllm-tui` on `127.0.0.1:18020`, or a user's own TUI provider) still
 * occupies a GPU. Whether either is on THIS box is decided by

// dispatches landing inside that window would both read the same snapshot and
// both pass the cap, which is the exact over-dispatch #4834 exists to stop.

// So the chokepoint reserves the slot up front and releases it once the spawn
// settles — by which point the agent record carries the load. This is a simple
// in-process re-entrancy guard over one server's own dispatch loop, not a
// defense against competing actors (see the Security Model in AGENTS.md).
// Mirrors `spawningJobIds` in cosJobScheduler.js, which bridges the same gap.
//
// Each reservation carries its task id, because `registerAgent` flips the record
// to `running` well BEFORE `spawnAgentForTask` returns: for the config + PTY
// launch window one agent would otherwise be counted twice (running tally AND
// reservation) and under-admit at limits above 1. Counting only reservations
// whose task has no running agent yet removes the overlap exactly, without
// releasing early and reopening the window the reservation exists to close.
