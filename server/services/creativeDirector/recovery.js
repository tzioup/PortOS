/**
 * Creative Director — boot-time recovery.
 *
 * Server restarts (deploys, watchers, OOM kills) abort any in-flight render
 * and tear down the in-memory listeners that runSceneRender attaches. Without
 * recovery the project sits in `rendering` / `stitching` forever — its scene
 * status fields point at jobs that the queue already reclassified as
 * 'failed (interrupted by restart)' but nothing fires advanceAfterSceneSettled
 * to push the project forward.
 *
 * On boot, after the media-job queue reloads its persisted state, we:
 *   1. Find every project that's mid-flight (status in planning/rendering/
 *      stitching).
 *   2. Reset any scenes stuck in `rendering` or `evaluating` back to `pending`
 *      — their listeners are gone, the render is dead, the only sane next
 *      action is to redo them.
 *   3. Mark any persisted `runs[]` row in `running` state as failed —
 *      the agent task behind it died with the previous process. Without
 *      this, advanceAfterSceneSettled's persisted-runs guard (which treats
 *      any non-terminal `treatment` run as "another worker is on it")
 *      would silently refuse to enqueue a replacement and the project
 *      would stay stuck in `planning` forever.
 *   4. Call `advanceAfterSceneSettled` to resume each project. It picks up
 *      from wherever the project stopped: re-renders pending scenes, fires a
 *      fresh evaluate task, runs the stitch, etc.
