/**
 * Repo Sync — deterministic core for the `repo-sync` scheduled task.
 *
 * Walks every managed app's checkout (PortOS itself is one of them) and puts it
 * back in the state a fresh piece of work wants to start from: on the default
 * branch, level with origin in both directions, no leftover local branches or
 * worktrees, and an empty stash list.
 *
 * Two tiers, in the same shape branchReconcile.js uses:
 *
 *   Tier 1 (this module) — everything PROVABLE. Fetch, push branches that are
 *     strictly ahead of their upstream, fast-forward the default branch, return
 *     the checkout to the default branch when the branch it is on is already
 *     merged, delete merged branches/worktrees (delegated to
 *     `branchReconcile.reconcile`), and drop stash entries whose content is
 *     byte-identical to the default branch. No agent, no LLM call.
 *
 *   Tier 2 (the caller) — everything that needs JUDGMENT is returned as an
 *     `escalations` list for a coordinator CoS agent: a half-finished
 *     merge/rebase, uncommitted work of unknown provenance, a branch that has
 *     diverged from its upstream, unpushed commits with no PR, a stash that
 *     is NOT provably redundant. This module never spawns an agent, so it stays
 *     pure enough to unit-test.
 *
 * NOTHING here can lose work. Every mutating step is gated on a property that
 * makes it recoverable or a no-op:
 *   - push never uses `--force` and never runs on a branch that is behind.
 *   - the default branch only ever fast-forwards (`--ff-only`, or a
 *     `fetch origin <b>:<b>` refspec, which git itself refuses to non-FF).
 *   - the checkout only switches off a branch that is CLEAN and already merged.
 *   - branch/worktree deletion runs through branchReconcile's existing gates.
 *   - a stash is dropped only when every path it touches already has identical
 *     content on the default branch, i.e. applying it would produce no diff.
 * Anything that fails one of those gates is REPORTED, never forced.
 *
 * SCOPE BOUNDARY with branch-reconcile: this task reports an in-flight branch
 * (one that needs a PR opened, a conflict resolved, or a review driven) but does
 * NOT drive it. That is branch-reconcile's job, and it wraps the same classified
 * set in machinery this task has no equivalent of — the per-app openPr /
 * resolveConflicts / autoMerge / finishAbandoned toggles, per-agent batching, the
 * drain convergence guards, and the superseded ledger. Acting on those branches
 * here would bypass all of it, so the coordinator prompt names branch-reconcile
 * instead.
