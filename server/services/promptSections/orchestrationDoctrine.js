/**
 * Architect-doctrine prompt section for orchestrated CoS runs (#5992).
 *
 * An orchestrated task's top-level agent is the ARCHITECT: it plans, writes a
 * spec per unit of work, and delegates execution to lanes running on cheaper
 * models. The delegated lane shares NONE of the architect's context — it sees
 * only the spec text — so a spec that omits any of the six parts is a lane that
 * has to guess, and guessing is what makes cheap-model delegation fail.
 *
 * The section is the whole delivery mechanism for the per-step reasoning rung:
 * PortOS cannot intercept an agent's own sub-agent dispatch, so the contract is
 * stated here and the architect writes `REASONING: <rung>` into each spec, which
 * `thinkingLevels.resolveStepEffort` then reads back without rounding.
 *
 * Renders '' for every `direct`-mode task, which is every task by default.
