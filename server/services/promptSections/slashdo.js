/**
 * The ONE reviewer contract a slashdo invocation runs under — resolved before the
 * body is pruned, before a `--review-with` is pinned, and before any per-reviewer
 * effort instruction is emitted (#6261).
 *
 * There are two sources, and slashdo's own precedence
 * (`lib/review-config-defaults.md`) puts them in this order:
 *
 * 1. **An explicit `--review-with` in the task's `slashdoArgs`.** PortOS passes
 *    those arguments through verbatim, so a typed flag is what the run WILL use —
 *    above task metadata, above the install's Code Review Defaults, above
 *    slashdo's own saved defaults. Prune for exactly it, and pin nothing: the
 *    invocation already carries the value, suffixes and all.
 * 2. **Task metadata + Code Review Defaults**, via `resolveReviewerConfig`. This is
 *    the historical path, and it still owns every invocation that names no flag.
 *
 * Deriving `skipIncludes` from (2) while (1) rides the invocation is the bug this
 * function exists to make impossible: the prompt requested one reviewer, omitted
 * its loop, and instructed the agent to use another. `--review-with none` was the
 * worst case — an explicit opt-out silently overridden by an inherited default.
 *
 * An explicit flag PortOS cannot safely read (`{ unresolved: true }` — an open
 * quote or bracket, a shell expansion, a slug or suffix outside the grammar we
 * mirror) preserves the arguments and prunes and pins NOTHING. A fat prompt costs
 * tokens; a prompt missing the loop the run actually reaches costs the run.
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT touch the completion workflow's own reviewer
 * resolution further down the prompt — that is a separate `/do:pr` invocation with
 * its own arguments, and an explicit flag on THIS one says nothing about it.
 *
 * @param {Object} task - the CoS task (reads `metadata.slashdoArgs` + reviewer pins)
 * @param {Object} [opts]
 * @param {Object|null} [opts.codeReviewDefaults]
 * @param {string[]|null} [opts.defaultReviewers]
 * @returns {{skipIncludes: string[], reviewWith: string, reviewerEffortNote: string,
 *   explicitReviewWith: boolean}}

  // third clause for a copilot `~effort=`; there is deliberately none here, because
  // copilot has no effort ladder at all (`REVIEWER_EFFORT_LEVELS` is keyed off
  // `reviewerCliBinary`, and copilot names no binary), so `normalizeReviewerEfforts`
  // drops the pin long before either function sees it.

/**
 * Fold a slashdo-backed task's invocation + procedure into its description (#3089).
 *
 * A task that names a bundled workflow persists only the BARE command
 * (`metadata.slashdoCommand`) because the form's provider select defaults to
 * "Auto" — the concrete shape (`/do:x`, `/do-x`, or an Agent Skill selected by
 * name) is only knowable here, once the scheduler has picked a provider.
 *
 * The command body travels with the prompt for every provider, not just the
 * skill-style ones: PortOS ships slashdo as a submodule and only surfaces it as
 * slash commands via the repo-local `.claude/commands/do/` symlinks, which don't
 * exist in the managed-app workspaces most CoS tasks run in.
 *
 * File-tool hosts receive slashdo's deferred bundle: an entrypoint and supporting
 * files read only at the relevant phase. API providers receive an eager body.
 * Oversized bodies without references still use the existing file pointer.
 *
 * Pruning is only sound if the run then uses the reviewers we pruned FOR, so the
 * body, the emitted pin, and the effort instruction all come from ONE resolved
 * reviewer contract — `resolveSlashdoReviewContract` above, which puts an explicit
 * `--review-with` in the invocation's own arguments ahead of task metadata and the
 * install defaults, exactly as slashdo does.
 *
 * Applied to the description (on a COPY — the stored task is untouched) rather
 * than emitted as its own template slot, because the briefing template renders
 * `{{task.description}}`: a new `{{slashdoSection}}` placeholder would be
 * silently dropped by every install whose customized template predates it.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} the task, or a copy carrying the invocation
