/**
 * Beeper ↔ Tribe identity linking (#34, decided on #10, built on the schema
 * from #27/PR42). Relates a `beeper_participants` row to a `tribe_people`
 * row via the split-by-durability design:
 *
 *   - A durable handle (a phone, ~81% of one-to-one counterparties, or a
 *     network username, ~6%) resolves through `tribe_identities` — see
 *     `server/services/tribeIdentities.js` — PLUS, for a phone specifically,
 *     the existing Tribe phone matcher (`tribeMatch.js`/`tribe.listPeople()`),
 *     since a WhatsApp/Signal/Google-Messages phone is very plausibly already
 *     on a Tribe person from calendar/iMessage/Contacts. Resolution never
 *     creates a person — only matches an existing one — so the auto path can
 *     never produce a duplicate.
 *   - No durable handle at all (~13%) has nothing HANDLE-shaped to resolve
 *     against, so every EXPLICIT link (`linkParticipant` /
 *     `createPersonAndLinkParticipant`) also claims a `kind='beeper-user'`
 *     identity keyed on the participant's own account and Beeper user id (see
 *     `beeperUserScopeFor`), and `beeper_participants.tribe_person_id` drops
 *     to being a pure cache for that case too.
 *
 * `kind='beeper-user'` OVERLOADS the existing `UNIQUE (kind, network, handle)`
 * index rather than adding a column (#96): `network` carries the participant's
 * `beeper_conversations.account_id` and `handle` carries its raw
 * `source_user_id`. That pair is Beeper's own per-account `User.id`, stable
 * across resweeps, where the mirror's `conversation_id` is a PortOS UUID
 * re-minted by every purge — so the claim survives a purge + resweep by
 * construction (`tribe_identities` has no FK onto anything Beeper-side).
 * The ACCOUNT, not the network, is the scope: two bridge accounts on the same
 * network mint their own independent user-id space. The overload is documented
 * on the table itself in `server/lib/db/schema/tribe.js`; a `source_user_id`
 * is an opaque id, so it is stored RAW and never routed through
 * `classifyNetworkHandle` (which exists for phones/usernames only).
 *
 * `upsertParticipant` is the participant-row writer the ingestion sweep (#32)
 * calls on every sync pass — its ON CONFLICT clause deliberately never
 * touches `tribe_person_id`, so a manual link on the 13%-no-handle case
 * survives every re-sync (#34 acceptance); its post-insert auto-resolve is
 * what re-fills the cache from the `beeper-user` claim after a purge (#96).
 *
 * Touchpoints: `logSenderTouchpoints` relates a GROUP conversation by message
 * SENDER only — Beeper's participant roster truncates (20/100, no cursor) so
 * it is never a complete membership list; iterating it to log touchpoints for
 * everyone "in" a group would silently invent contact with people who never
 * actually messaged. A message's `senderID` is always a real, present
 * participant, so deriving touchpoints from messages (never from the roster)
 * is correct for a 1:1 chat too, not just a group.

 * is a CACHE, authoritative **only** where no durable handle exists (the ~13%
 * with neither a phone nor a username). Reading it first made it authoritative
 * for 100% and froze the truth table out of every already-cached row — a cache
 * auto-filled from the legacy `tribe_people.phones[]` axis would permanently
 * outrank a later explicit claim on the same phone, and after `linkParticipant`
 * moves ownership of a handle, every OTHER participant row carrying it would

 *      the claim is the record of an explicit user action, the column is a

 *      (it is a manual link, so it outranks the legacy array below). Null'd
 *      when it points at a soft-deleted person — see `rowToParticipant`.
 *   4. for a phone specifically, the existing Tribe phone matcher — a

 * `account_id = network` — `beeperUserScopeFor`'s own key, the durable pair
 * that survives a purge + resweep, so it finds every conversation for that
 * Beeper user even one synced after the claim was made.
 *
 * A `kind='handle'`/`'phone'` claim instead reads the resolved participant
 * CACHE (`beeper_participants.tribe_person_id = personId`) rather than
 * re-deriving the handle scope per participant row with `identityScopeFor`:
 * the ingestion sweep's `upsertParticipant` already keeps that column in
 * sync with `tribe_identities` for every synced participant, so the cache is
 * already the correct, much simpler answer to "which conversations is this
 * identity seen in" (#99 decision — documented here rather than mirroring
 * `clearDisplacedParticipantCaches`'s per-row reclassification). A `phone`
 * claim is network-less by design, so it reads the cache unscoped by
 * network; a `handle` claim additionally filters to its own network, since
 * the same cached person can hold claims on more than one network.
 *
 * A purged conversation or a participant row nulled by a later re-link
 * simply produces no row here — no special-casing needed.
