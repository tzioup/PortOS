/**
 * Tribe Outreach (#2158)
 *
 * Timeline-aware outreach for Tribe relationships — the follow-on to the
 * cadence-only nudges in `proactiveAlerts.js`. Two layers, deliberately split so
 * the AI-provider policy holds (no cold-bootstrap LLM calls):
 *
 *   1. Detection (NO LLM) — `findUnansweredTribeThreads()` scans the human-activity
 *      timeline (#2150) for inbound messages from Tribe people that were never
 *      replied to, grouped by conversation. Pure timeline + Tribe reads, cheap and
 *      safe to run from the on-demand proactive-alerts sweep and background jobs.
 *
 *   2. Draft generation (USER-ACTION-GATED LLM) — `generateOutreachDraft()` takes
 *      one detected thread, grounds a reply in the real conversation (the message
 *      cache when available, else the timeline's own message summaries), runs the
 *      existing reply-generation pipeline (`messageEvaluator.generateReplyBody`),
 *      and files a DRAFT through `messageDrafts.createDraft`. It NEVER auto-sends —
 *      the user reviews/approves/sends through the existing draft pipeline.
 *
 * The detection layer is source-agnostic in shape but gated to sources whose
 * ingestion records BOTH directions per conversation, so an "unanswered" verdict is
 * trustworthy: iMessage (#2151) and Signal (#2154) source-wide, and Gmail (#2033)
 * PER ACCOUNT once its sent mail is ingested as `message.sent` (#2796). See
 * `buildTwoWayGate` for the per-account gate.

 *   - it isn't opted out (`syncConfig.ingestSent !== false` — absent means the
 *     default-on capability);
 *   - it has an owner email set (sent-vs-received direction needs it — see
 *     `messageActivityCandidates`; without it no `message.sent` events are produced,
 *     so every inbound would read as unanswered);
 *   - it is enabled (a disabled account never syncs, so its sent history never
 *     updates — trusting it would nudge on stale/absent reply evidence);
 *   - its last sent sync was NOT truncated (`sentCoveragePartial !== true`, #2820):
 *     a sync that hit the sent ceiling (>SENT_INGEST_MAX in the window) has an
 *     incomplete sent window, so an un-ingested older reply could read as
 *     unanswered — fail closed until a full sync clears the flag;
 *   - it has a RECENT sent-ingest watermark (`sentIngestedAt` within `coverageMs`).
 *     This is the reliability guard: an account default-on at upgrade, or one whose
 *     OAuth/sync has been failing, has no current sent evidence — trusting it on
 *     config alone would produce false "unanswered" nudges for already-replied
 *     threads. `coverageMs` defaults to Infinity (presence-only) for pure tests; the

 *   `emailAccounts` are the two-way email accounts to query PER ACCOUNT (#2820) so
