/**
 * Writers Room — Phase 4 synchronized prose/script/media review surface.
 *
 * This is a *read-model*: it derives the prose↔script↔media mapping from data
 * that already exists immutably elsewhere rather than persisting a fourth copy.
 *   - prose segments  ← the active draft's `segmentIndex` (built on every save)
 *   - script scenes   ← the `script` analysis snapshot's `result.scenes[]`,
 *                       each carrying `sourceSegmentIds` back to prose
 *   - media refs      ← the same snapshot's `sceneImages` map (scene → image)
 *   - cast integrity  ← the per-work character bible, measured by the shared
 *                       characterIntegrity.js contract and joined to the
 *                       scenes that stage each character (#6415/#6417)
 *
 * Deriving on read (instead of a persisted render-plan store) means there is no
 * second source of truth to keep in sync, and staleness falls straight out of
 * the analysis snapshot's pinned `sourceContentHash` vs. the live draft hash —
 * the same contentHash machinery the rest of Writers Room already uses.
 *
 * The mapping model from docs/features/writers-room.md ("Synchronized Review
 * Surface") is expressed *relationally* across the three pane arrays — every
 * prose segment lists the script scenes mapped to it; every scene lists the
 * prose segments it adapts and the media rendered from it; every media item
 * carries its full provenance back to scene + prose. There is intentionally no
 * separate `mappings[]` array — that would be a redundant denormalization of
 * exactly these cross-references.

/**
 * Cast integrity for the synced review (#6415, and the remaining half of #6417).
 *
 * The synced review is the one Writers Room surface where a COLD READ of the
 * draft (the `script` analysis, which derives scenes and their speaking cast
 * from the prose alone) sits beside AUTHOR KNOWLEDGE (the per-work character
 * bible, which holds the framework the reader never sees). Reporting cast
 * integrity here is what lets the author see the two disagree.
 *
 * The two are deliberately kept apart, in both directions:
 *
 *   - **Script evidence never closes a framework gap.** The integrity findings
 *     are measured by `buildCastIntegrityReport` against the AUTHORED record
 *     only. A character who is vividly on the page and blank in the bible still
 *     reports every gap — an interior that exists only in the author's head is
 *     exactly the defect this contract was written for.
 *   - **The bible never invents a scene, and the cold read never invents a
 *     character.** A name the extraction found that matches no bible entry is
 *     reported as `unmatchedNames`, NOT as a finding: the report has no record
 *     to attach a field path to, and inventing one would be the same failure as
 *     inventing a field. Symmetrically, an authored character no scene stages is
 *     reported `staged: false` and is NOT a finding — an offstage character is a
 *     legitimate authoring choice, not an integrity defect.
 *
 * Zero provider calls, exactly like every other pane here: this is the
 * deterministic completeness pass plus a join against scenes that already
 * exist. The semantic pass is an explicitly-invoked action elsewhere, so
 * `semanticReviewedCount` is 0 and `passed` is false by construction — a
 * deterministic pass alone never licenses "this cast is clean".
