/**
 * Writers Room — cross-peer federation facade (#1565).
 *
 * The single import surface for the peer-sync graph (peerSync.js) and tombstone
 * GC (tombstoneGc.js). Routes the LWW/tombstone merge + prune through the active
 * storage backend (store.js → db.js or the file backend) and owns the two
 * facade-level concerns the backends can't: the file-primary draft `.md` BODY
 * asset manifest (sender) + diff (receiver), and the on-disk cleanup + base-hash
 * eviction when a tombstone is hard-pruned.
 *
 * Mirrors creativeDirector/local.js's federation re-exports + moodBoard/index.js,
 * but keeps the announce hooks in local.js (the mutators live there). This module
 * does NOT import peerSync — peerSync statically imports `mergeWorksFromSync`
 * from here, so importing it back would close a load-order cycle.
