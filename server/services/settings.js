/**
 * Security-sensitive STRICT read of settings.json for the auth gate (#2684).
 *
 * The normal loadRaw()/getSettings() path collapses THREE distinct states to
 * `{}`: an ABSENT file (fresh install — legitimately no settings), a file that
 * exists but can't be READ (permission / I/O error), and a file that reads but
 * won't PARSE (truncated / corrupt JSON, or a non-object root). For feature
 * reads that collapse is fine, but for the auth-enabled decision it fails OPEN:
 * a corrupt settings.json makes `isAuthEnabled()` compute `false` over `{}` and
 * silently disables the password gate (see `server/services/authGate.js`).
 *
 * This read preserves the distinction so a security caller can fail CLOSED on
 * the two failure modes while still treating a genuinely absent file as
 * "auth off" (the correct default for a fresh install):
 *   { present: false, corrupt: false } → absent (ENOENT): auth legitimately off
 *   { present: true,  corrupt: true }  → exists but unreadable/unparseable: fail closed
 *   { present: true,  corrupt: false } → parsed cleanly into `settings`
 *
 * `settings` is always a plain object (`{}` in the two non-clean cases) so
 * callers can read it unconditionally; they gate their fail-closed behavior on
 * `corrupt`. The default path is the real SETTINGS_FILE; the optional argument
 * exists so unit tests can point it at a temp file without touching real data.

// Read-side cache. `getSettings()` is called 100+ times across the codebase
// (many per request), and each call previously did a fresh filesystem read +
// JSON.parse. Settings is app-wide, rarely-changing data — a textbook memoize.
// Correctness contract:
// - The cache is populated lazily on the first `getSettings()` and refreshed
//   from the `settings:updated` event the SAME emitter already fires on every
//   `save()` — so any write through the app (saveSettings/updateSettings/
//   updateSettingsWith) keeps the cache warm and consistent.
// - Write paths (`save`, `updateSettings`, `updateSettingsWith`) deliberately
//   still read `loadRaw()` off disk inside the write queue for their
//   read-merge-write, so their base snapshot is always the freshest persisted
//   truth, never the cache. The post-write `settings:updated` then syncs the
//   cache. This keeps the write-ordering guarantees intact.
// - `null` = not-yet-loaded (distinct from a legitimately empty `{}`), so a
//   fresh process reads disk exactly once.
// - The prior `stripStoreKeys(await loadRaw())` handed every caller a fresh deep
//   object graph, so callers may mutate nested settings in place. To preserve
//   that isolation the cache is never handed out directly: reads deep-clone it,
//   and the `settings:updated` listener stores a private clone (save() emits the
//   same `cleaned` object it also returns to its caller). structuredClone is the
//   right tool for this JSON-shaped data and stays far cheaper than the disk
//   read + full-tree JSON.parse it replaces.
