/**
 * The Beeper attachment byte mirror (#37, decided on #13).
 *
 * **Lazy.** Ingestion (#32) writes the attachment's METADATA and its durable
 * `mxc_id` reference; the bytes arrive only when a human actually opens the
 * thread that shows them. A mirrored account's attachment history runs to
 * gigabytes, so "fetch everything on ingest" is a transfer nobody asked for —
 * the same reasoning root AGENTS.md applies to unbidden LLM calls, applied to
 * bytes. The bulk backfill exists, but it is a user action behind a consent
 * step that names the count and the size first.
 *
 * **Content-addressed, so deletion is never a one-liner.** Files live at
 * `data/beeper/attachments/<sha256[0..2]>/<sha256>.<ext>`
 * (`lib/beeperAttachmentPaths.js`), which means one photo forwarded into four
 * chats is one file and four rows. Every unlink path here therefore asks
 * "does any OTHER row still point at this path?" first — the shape
 * `chatgptImport.js` uses for its shared import assets.
 *
 * **A 502 is terminal, and it is also a keep.** `GET /v1/assets/serve` answers
 * `502` for media the source network has aged out, which `beeperClient` maps
 * to `ASSET_UNAVAILABLE`. Two consequences, and they pull in opposite
 * directions on purpose: the row is stamped `unavailable_at` so nothing
 * re-requests it on every render (the retry loop #13 called out), and a row
 * already holding bytes is exempted from eviction, because a file Beeper can
 * no longer supply is the last copy in existence.
 *
 * Nothing here ever sends anything through a messaging API.
