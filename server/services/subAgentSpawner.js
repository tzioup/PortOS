/**
 * Sub-Agent Spawner Service — the agent cluster's EVENT WIRING.
 *
 * Owns `initSpawner()`: the CoS Runner connection, the runner event handlers
 * (`agent:output` / `agent:completed` / `agents:orphaned` / `agent:error`), the
 * `task:ready` → spawn and `agent:terminate` → terminate listeners, run-directory
 * pruning, and the delayed orphan sweep. Nothing else.
 *
 * ## It is no longer a barrel (#3450)
 *
 * Until #3450 this file also re-exported ~40 symbols from nine sibling modules
 * "for backward compatibility" — a second, partial view of the cluster layered
 * over the `cosAgents.js` barrel (since retired too) and `cos.js`'s agent block,
 * including three process-layer transitions `agentOrchestrator.js` also owns.
 * Two barrels naming the same transition is how a caller ends up importing the
 * wrong one and the layering stops meaning anything. The re-exports are gone;
 * the surviving consumers of this module import `initSpawner` (`bootstrap.js`)
 * and `loadSlashdoCommand` (CoS agent prompts), and everything else now imports
 * the module that actually defines it — or, for a lifecycle transition,
 * `agentOrchestrator.js`.
 *
 * That is also why this module can take a static `agentOrchestrator.js` import
 * while the modules it wires cannot: with the barrel retired, nothing in the
 * facade's closure imports this file at all.
 *
 * NOTE: importing this module is side-effect-free — `initSpawner()` must be
 * called explicitly (see `server/index.js`). This keeps test imports from
 * re-arming the event listeners and timers on every suite.
