/**
 * Agent Repo-State Verification
 *
 * The programmatic audit that runs after `cleanupAgentWorktree` and asks the
 * question cleanup cannot: is the repository actually in the state this task
 * asked for?
 *
 * Cleanup reports only what it TRIED and failed to do. The case this exists for
 * is an agent that owns its own PR workflow (`ownsPrWorkflow`), merges the PR
 * itself, and exits before deleting the branch — or exits with the PR still open.
 * Cleanup stands down for exactly those runs, so nothing checked, and the branch
 * plus its worktree persist through every later sweep that treats "an agent owns
 * it" as a reason to skip. (`removeWorktree` also only `console.log`s a failed
 * `git branch -D`, so even the attempted delete can fail silently.)
 *
 * What it does NOT do: touch anything. It probes, classifies (via the pure
 * `lib/repoStateExpectations.js`), and files ONE recovery task. Deleting a branch
 * from here would be a destructive action on the basis of a heuristic, which is
 * what `branchReconcile.js` is careful not to do either.
 *
 * Detection is what this adds over `branchReconcile.js`: that reconciler is an
 * opt-in scheduled task on a recheck cadence, and it parks on no-progress. This
 * is immediate, per-agent, and attributed to the run that caused it.
 *
 * Gated per managed app by `verifyRepoStateOnCompletion` (default ON).
 *
 * Concurrency: other agents legitimately hold their own worktrees and branches at
 * the same time. Every probe is scoped to ONE branch — the one this agent owned —
 * so a live sibling agent is structurally invisible to it.
