/**
 * Branch & PR Reconciler — deterministic core (Tier 1).
 *
 * Enumerates THIS machine's local branches (`refs/heads/`), classifies each by
 * its merge / PR state, and deterministically cleans up the fully-merged,
 * orphaned ones (remove the lingering worktree + delete the local branch).
 * Everything that needs judgment (open a PR, resolve conflicts, drive a review
 * loop, merge) is returned in `inFlight` for the scheduler to hand to a
 * coordinator CoS agent — this module never spawns an agent, so it stays pure
 * enough to unit-test.
 *
 * PEER SAFETY: only `refs/heads/` (local) branches are ever *driven*. A branch
 * created on a federated peer exists here only as a remote-tracking ref
 * (`origin/*`), never as a local branch, so it is structurally invisible to the
 * classifier. We never author-filter — every machine shares one GitHub login, so
 * authorship can't distinguish machines; local-branch existence can.
 *
 * The one thing that DOES look at the remote is the orphan sweep
 * (`reapOrphanedRemotes`), and it stays peer-safe by only ever deleting a remote
 * branch whose work is already merged into the default branch — a state in which
 * no machine, ours or a peer's, can lose anything. An unmerged remote-only branch
 * is reported, never touched.

 * Why this branch must be left ALONE this cycle — the dispatch-side counterpart to

 *
 * 1. **Liveness we could not determine.** `worktreeProtectionReason` is only ever
 *    called with an authoritative `activeAgentIds` Set (cleanupMerged defaults it to
 *    an empty one), so a missing Set reads there as "no agents running" and returns
 *    null. For a DISPATCH decision that default is backwards: an `agent-*` worktree
 *    whose owner's liveness is UNKNOWN must be presumed live, exactly as
 *    `isAbandonedAgentWorktree` presumes it. Fail safe toward not-touching.
 * 2. **A live agent whose worktree is already GONE.** Ownership is in the branch
 *    NAME, not the worktree: CoS branches are `cos/<taskId>/<agentId>` and the
 *    worktree basename is that same `<agentId>`. An agent that removed its worktree
 *    while still running — `/do:pr`'s Phase-7 cleanup does exactly this, before the
 *    session ends — leaves a pushed branch with an open PR and no worktree row, which
 *    otherwise classifies IN_REVIEW and gets handed to the coordinator while its own
 *    agent is still working. That is the bug this whole guard exists to prevent,
 *    surviving in a narrower window. So the branch name is checked too.
 * 3. **A claim directory, which is a claim MARKER and not a live process.** The
 *    claim flow has no durable local agent id for its branch, so treating the
 *    directory's existence as liveness hides clean, open-PR claims after the
 *    claim agent has exited — exactly the branches branch-reconcile exists to
 *    finish. So this side passes `allowLiveClaim`, while cleanup keeps the hold
 *    through `worktreeProtectionReason` until the claim is stale or provably
 *    shipped. A lock still outranks it: the gate tests the lock BEFORE the
 *    claim, so a locked claim tree reports `worktree-locked` on its own — and
 *    so does a live agent, on the same ordering. `activeAgentIds` holds
 *    `agent-<id>` keys (case 2 above reads them as such), so a claim basename
 *    can only appear there out of contract; if one ever did, holding the branch
 *    is the fail-safe answer and the intended precedence.
