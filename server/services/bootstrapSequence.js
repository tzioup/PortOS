/**
 * The load-bearing ORDER of server boot, extracted from `bootstrap.js` (#3451).
 *
 * `bootstrap.js` owns *what* each boot step is — the real migration runner, the
 * real AI Toolkit, the real stores, the real listener. This module owns *when*
 * each step runs relative to its neighbours, and receives every step as an
 * injected parameter. That split is the whole point: the ordering contract the
 * `bootstrap.js` header describes ("ordering inside each phase is load-bearing")
 * can then be executed and asserted by `bootstrapSequence.test.js` without
 * importing a module graph that would open a real listener, touch the real
 * database, or reach a provider.
 *
 * Rules for editing:
 *   - Nothing here may import a PortOS service, `db.js`, or the AI Toolkit.
 *     Every dependency arrives as a parameter; that is what keeps this testable.
 *   - `await` vs fire-and-forget is part of the contract, not an accident: an
 *     awaited step blocks every later step, and the tests assert which is which.
 *   - No step here may reach an AI provider (AGENTS.md "No cold-bootstrap LLM
 *     calls"). Boot loads on-disk state and ARMS schedulers, nothing more.

 *      `npm run migrations` must still land new prompt stages before then.
 *   2. `loadUsage` runs after migrations so both operations cannot race while
 *      updating the same usage snapshot.
 *   3. `verifyCollections` runs before anything can serve a request, and only
 *      logs: a hard exit on a schema mismatch is worse than a noisy log.
 *   4. `createToolkit` → `registerToolkitShims` → `warmProviders`: the shims
 *      hand the toolkit to the compatibility modules before the providers file
 *      is warmed, so the codex-sentinel migration write completes before any
 *      request can consult providers state (hence the await).
 *   5. `registerRunners` before the workers below, so a run dispatched by the
 *      spawner cannot land on a toolkit without PortOS's CLI/TUI runners.
 *   6. `startSpawner` LAST, and its promise is returned (not awaited): CoS init
 *      in the post-route phase gates on it so `task:ready` can't be emitted
 *      before the spawner registered its listener.
 *
 * Returns `{ aiToolkit, spawnerReady }`.
