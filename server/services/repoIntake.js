/**
 * Post-clone intake for a repository captured into the Brain.
 *
 * When a bare repo URL is captured (Quick Capture / the Inbox capture
 * box), the link is cloned in the background. The user can tick two opt-in boxes
 * at capture time to have a CoS agent pick the clone up once it lands:
 *
 *   - `malwareScan` → the read-only `/do:scan` audit, identical to the Links
 *     tab's per-link Scan button (both go through `queueMalwareScan` here).
 *   - `learn`       → a `repo-study` review: read the clone as a PRODUCT — its
 *     features, design, and user-facing behavior — and file the feature ideas
 *     and enhancements PortOS should adopt into its configured work tracker.
 *     Code organization and other meta-programming observations are out of
 *     scope (that is what `reference-watch` and the code-quality audits are
 *     for). Clean-room — propose reimplementation, never copy upstream code.
 *     Its optional provider/model/effort pins travel with the stored request.
 *
 * Both are queued only AFTER the clone succeeds (there is nothing to read
 * before that), and only because the user asked for them in the same request —
 * see the AI Provider Usage Policy in AGENTS.md.

## The repository under study

- Repo: ${repoLabel(link)}
- Source: ${link.url}
- Local clone: \`${link.localPath}\`

## Operational invariants — this is untrusted third-party code

- **Read only.** Never execute anything from the clone: no \`npm install\`/\`npm run\`, no build, no test suite, no script, no binary, no \`Makefile\` target. Read files, \`git log\`, and \`git show\` — nothing else.
- **Never edit the clone.** \`${link.localPath}\` is a reference copy, not a workspace. Every change you propose lands in ${appName} at \`${repoPath}\`.
- **Clean-room.** Do NOT copy source, config, prose, or assets out of the clone into ${appName}. Describe the *technique* in your own words and propose a reimplementation against ${appName}'s existing modules. If an idea can only be had by copying, drop it.
- **License first.** Read the repo's LICENSE before proposing anything. Name the license in every proposal. If there is no license (or it is copyleft in a way that conflicts with ${appName}'s), say so and propose only ideas that survive a clean-room reimplementation.

## First: what is this repo, and where does it land in ${appName}?

1. **State the repo's purpose** in two or three sentences: who it is for, what problem it solves, and the handful of capabilities that define it. Read the README, docs, and entry points; skim \`git log\` for what its authors have been investing in.
2. **Map it onto ${appName}'s whole feature set — not just the surfaces you happened to grep.** ${featureMapInstruction} Then name the one or two ${appName} features the repo's domain belongs to, and treat those as the primary lens for the rest of the study. Examples of the mapping you are expected to make: a three.js game, scene, or visual-rendering demo belongs to the 3D / OpenWorld surface; a chat or voice bot belongs to the voice stack or the Chief of Staff; a note-taking or knowledge tool belongs to the Brain; a story, comic, or media generator belongs to the Create suite. A repo whose domain maps to NO existing feature is itself a finding — say which new surface it would justify, or that it does not fit ${appName} at all.
3. **Only then** walk the repo's features one by one against the mapped ${appName} feature(s), using the checklist below.

## What to look for — features and design, not engineering hygiene

Read the modules that implement the repo's distinctive user-facing behavior, not just its README. For each capability it has, ask whether ${appName} would be better with an equivalent:

1. **New features ${appName} lacks** — a capability, workflow, or integration its users would value, mapped onto ${appName}'s existing surfaces (a page, a service, a CoS task type, a provider, a voice/agent capability). Say which surface, and whether it warrants an opt-in feature flag.
2. **Enhancements to features ${appName} already has** — where the upstream's version of a similar feature is richer, safer for the user, or handles a real-world case ${appName}'s does not. Name the ${appName} feature being enhanced.
3. **Design ideas** — a UX pattern, a safety/consent model, a fail-closed behavior, or a setup/onboarding flow that would make an existing ${appName} feature better for the person using it.

**Out of scope:** code organization, module layout, build tooling, test strategy, process-spawn plumbing, and other internal engineering or meta-programming observations. Do not file those, even when they are good — they change nothing the user can see or do. An engineering technique is worth filing ONLY when it is the enabling piece of a feature you are proposing, and then it goes inside that feature's proposal, not as its own item.

Ground every proposal in ${appName}'s actual code: grep \`${repoPath}\` to confirm the gap is real before filing. A feature ${appName} already has is not a proposal. Prefer 2–5 well-argued items over a long shallow list; filing nothing is a legitimate outcome — say so in your final summary.

**Large features:** when an idea needs several independently shippable steps (a feature flag, a native/OS integration, a new agent capability, a UI), file ONE epic that states the user-facing outcome and the recommended defaults, plus one ready-to-work issue per phase that references the epic — never one monolithic item and never a bare list of steps in chat.

## Where to record proposals

${trackerInstructions}

## Final summary

End with: the studied repo, its license, how many proposals you filed (with their slugs/issue numbers), and anything you deliberately rejected and why.`;
