/**
 * Beeper realtime transport (#33, decided on #12).
 *
 * One long-lived WebSocket from the PortOS server to Beeper Desktop's local
 * `/v1/ws`. The browser cannot hold this connection itself — Beeper binds to
 * loopback with CORS locked to the machine, and a browser cannot set an
 * `Authorization` header on `new WebSocket()` — so the server owns the socket
 * and relays over Socket.IO (`socket.js`, the `beeper` subscriber set).
 *
 * **The `ws` package, not Node's built-in WHATWG `WebSocket`.** A live 105-second
 * probe (#12) recorded a protocol-level server ping at 10.5s and then every 30s,
 * which the research note said did not exist. That ping is the only liveness
 * signal Beeper offers, and the built-in WebSocket does not surface ping frames
 * to application code at all — which is why `moltworldWs.js` cannot be copied
 * here, only imitated. Its reconnect shape is still the model.
 *
 * **This socket is not the source of truth.** Delivery is at-most-once with no
 * replay on reconnect, `seq` is per connection, an event is silently skipped
 * when the message is not yet retrievable, and the window before
 * `subscriptions.updated` is dark. Correctness comes from #32's HTTP sweep; the
 * socket only makes ingestion prompt, and asks the sweep to run early on the
 * three occasions frames could have been lost:
 *   - a reconnect (anything during the outage is gone),
 *   - a `seq` gap (frames dropped while the socket still looked healthy),
 *   - a recovery from an actionable `app.state` (the install was broken).
 *
 * **Never gated on `app.state`.** The probe measured it reporting `initializing`
 * for 105 continuous seconds while nine accounts were connected and a chat page
 * returned in 230ms. It is a display input for the settings card, never a gate.
 *
 * **Two gates, and the transport and the sweep sit behind different ones (#11).**
 *   - `isBeeperIngestionArmed()` — the instance FEATURE plus a stored token —
 *     arms the TRANSPORT. Holding the socket open writes nothing: it only feeds
 *     the settings card's liveness dot and its actionable `app.state` line,
 *     which is the surface a user needs precisely when they are deciding
 *     whether to turn ingestion on. So the connection is deliberately kept.
 *   - `settings.beeper.enabled` ("Enable scheduled Beeper sync", default OFF)
 *     is the user's ingestion opt-in, and it gates every `runBeeperSweep` call
 *     from here — re-read at EVERY trigger, exactly as
 *     `createSettingsGatedSyncScheduler.js` re-reads it on every tick, so
 *     flipping the toggle off mid-session stops sweeps without a restart.
 *     With it off the socket connects, subscribes and relays invalidations, and
 *     never writes a conversation or a message body to Postgres.
 *
 * Everything below runs OUTSIDE the Express request lifecycle — socket callbacks
 * and timers — so hook bodies catch and log rather than letting a throw take the
 * process down, per root AGENTS.md.
