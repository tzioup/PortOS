/**
 * Issue Reconciler — deterministic core.
 *
 * Finds ZOMBIE issues: open + `in-progress` (claimed-and-being-worked) yet with
 * their linked PR/MR already MERGED and NO live claim anywhere (no open PR/MR, no
 * local/remote/CoS claim branch, no active CoS agent). A zombie is an issue a
 * partial ship left stranded — the claim queue skips `in-progress`, so its
 * remaining scope is never re-picked and never finished.
 *
 * Forge-agnostic: the same scan runs over GitHub (`gh` issues + PRs), GitLab
 * (`glab` issues + merge requests), and JIRA (the PortOS JIRA API). The GitHub /
 * GitLab forge is resolved from the app's git `origin` host (github.* → GitHub,
 * gitlab.* → GitLab); any other remote returns null (skip/park). The pure
 * classifier, ref matchers, and convergence signature are shared — only the
 * effectful state gatherer differs per forge, and each normalizes into one common
 * `{ number, title, url, labels, assignees }` issue shape + `{ number,
 * headRefName, body, url }` change shape so the merge/classify logic never
 * branches on forge.
 *
 * JIRA is materially different and is NEVER auto-selected from the git host — it
 * requires explicit per-app config (`app.jira` + `workTracker: 'jira'`), so it is
 * routed in via the `jira` option (mirroring `resolveAppWorkTracker`) rather than
 * an origin-host lookup. Its "zombie" is STATUS-based, not label-based: JIRA has no
 * `in-progress` label to release, so a ticket left **In Review** with no live claim
 * is the shipped-but-stranded signal (the analog of a merged PR). Only In-Progress-
 * category tickets are scanned — **To Do** (not started) and **Done** (terminal,
 * the human closed it out) are excluded so the scan converges.
 * The live-claim guard is keyed on the ticket KEY (`claim/<KEY>` / `cos/…/<KEY>/…`
 * refs, local AND remote) so an open MR still under review — whose claim branch is
 * still present — reads as LIVE, while a merged-and-deleted branch reads as a
 * zombie. The deterministic scan is status + git-ref only (no forge CLI, no
 * dev-panel PR lookup); the coordinator reads the ticket + its linked MR/PR live to
 * confirm remaining scope before healing. JIRA tickets normalize into the SAME
 * common shape (KEY → `number`, `status` carried for the signature).
 *
 * A second, narrower stuck state is handled WITHOUT the coordinator: an
 * ABANDONED issue — `in-progress`, held by a non-owner (a human volunteer the
 * claim prompt or the issue-watcher handed it to), nothing shipped, and
 * untouched for FOREIGN_CLAIM_STALE_DAYS. Every flow that STAMPS `in-progress`
 * must own a path that releases it; the volunteer flows had none, so such an
 * issue matched STALLED on every pass forever. `releaseAbandonedClaims` is the
 * releaser, and it is the one write this module performs (see its doc for why it
 * skips the agent).
 *
 * The scheduler runs the deterministic scan here (gh/glab + git only — no LLM),
 * then hands the zombie set to a coordinator CoS agent that reads each issue + its
 * merged PR/MR and applies the partial-ship hybrid (close + file a scoped
 * follow-up when the remainder is separable, or comment "done/remaining" + release
 * the claim when it's a continuation). This module never spawns an agent, so it
 * stays pure enough to unit-test — mirroring `branchReconcile.js`.
 *
 * PEER SAFETY differs from branch-reconcile. Branch-reconcile only ever touches
 * LOCAL refs, so a peer's branch is structurally invisible. Issue state, by
 * contrast, is SHARED forge state across every federated peer. So the live-claim
 * guard deliberately consults REMOTE refs and OPEN PRs/MRs too — a claim in flight
 * on another machine shows up here as an `origin/*` ref or an open PR/MR, and must
 * suppress the zombie classification. Close/unlabel are idempotent across peers;
 * the one real race (two machines filing a duplicate follow-up) is deduped by the
 * coordinator, not here.
