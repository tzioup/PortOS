/**
 * Investigation-task producer — the one place a failure-driven task is filed.
 *
 * Four producers file "something broke, go find out why" tasks: an agent failure
 * (`agentErrorAnalysis.js`), an AI-provider failure and an uncaught crash
 * (`autoFixer.js`), and repeated agent orphaning (`agentManagement.js`). They all
 * have to agree on the same three things, and when each hand-assembled them they
 * did not:
 *
 *  - the APPROVAL verdict — unattended by default, held only on a failure loop;
 *  - the MARKERS (`isInvestigation`, `investigationFingerprint`, `affectedTasks`,
 *    `approvalReason`) that the dedup scan, the reaper, the meta-cascade guard,
 *    and the auto-retry all read;
 *  - the STORM COUNTER, which is only a real signal if every producer both reads
 *    it and contributes to it.
 *
 * Before this module, three of the four wrote no fingerprint at all — so
 * `repeat-fingerprint` could never fire for them — and only one pushed a
 * creation stamp, so `failure-storm` counted a quarter of the storm.
 *
 * Goes through the `cos.js` facade for its task I/O, matching the producers it
 * was extracted from — every one of them already imports `cos.js`, so this adds
 * no module edge, and `cos.js` imports nothing from here. (The RETRY side,
 * `investigationRetry.js`, must use `cosTaskStore` directly instead: `cos.js`
 * subscribes to it, so the facade would close a load-time cycle there.)

/**
 * File an investigation task with the shared verdict + markers, and record it
 * against the circuit.
 *
 * For the producers whose failure has no per-task dedup of its own (the provider,
 * crash, and orphan paths — each already guarded upstream by its own dedupe and
 * circuit breaker). The agent-failure producer keeps its own creation path: it
 * carries a durable fingerprint dedup that must union a repeat failure into the
 * SURVIVING investigation rather than file a new one, plus a serialization tail
 * closing the TOCTOU between the scan and the write.
 *
 * A held task gets the "why this is held for you" prose appended as a section, so
 * the user reading the queue does not have to infer why this one stopped for them.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT hard-suppress on `investigationCircuitOpen`. Its callers
 * already bound their own fan-out (autoFixer's per-resource dedupe + circuit; the
 * orphan path's own retry budget), and one of them — manual error recovery — is a
 * user clicking "investigate this"; silently dropping that because unrelated
 * failures filled the window is worse than filing it. The shared counter still
 * drives the softer `failure-storm` response: hold it for a human rather than
 * spend an unattended agent on a symptom.
 *
 * @param {{ fingerprint: string, description: string, affectedTasks?: string[] }} args
 *   plus any further `addTask` fields (priority, context, diagnostics)
 * @param {{ now?: number, taskType?: string, delivery?: object }} [opts] `taskType`
 *   and `delivery` are the two axes a USER-queued investigation differs on
 *   (#6043): it belongs in the user queue and its PR waits for the human who
 *   asked for it. Both default to the unattended auto-filed posture. `delivery`
 *   is applied AFTER the caller's fields on purpose — an investigation's
 *   isolation and PR posture are set by policy, not by the submitter.
 * @returns {Promise<{ task: object|null, approvalRequired: boolean, loopReason: string|null }>}
