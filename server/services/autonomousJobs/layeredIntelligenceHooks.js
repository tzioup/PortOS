/**
 * Layered Intelligence as programmatic-I/O hooks (issue-follow-up to #2322).
 *
 * LI used to run as a HANDLER-BACKED task — an inline `runPromptThroughProvider`
 * call wrapped in `runLayeredIntelligenceForApp`, invisible to the CoS queue /
 * Active Agents and un-attachable in a TUI. It is now a NORMAL agent-backed
 * scheduled task with two programmatic slots (see taskTypeHooks.js +
 * docs/plans/2026-07-09-programmatic-io-scheduled-tasks.md):
 *
 *   - `buildTaskInput({ app })` — the GATHER layer: park-check (skip if parked),
 *     gather the app's sources + open issues, and build the reasoning prompt the
 *     agent runs. Returns `{ prompt, skip? }`.
 *   - `processTaskOutput({ appId, payload, ... })` — the DECIDE + ACT layers:
 *     validate the agent's structured `.agent-done` payload, scope-gate, dedup
 *     (exact + semantic), file exactly one tracker issue, pause, optional Engine-A
 *     hand-off, and record last-run bookkeeping.
 *
 * The REASON layer is now the agent itself (visible, TUI-capable). Its worktree
 * is discarded without a commit (LI's task metadata sets discardWorktree), so the
 * agent can't land code — the structured payload is its only channel out, exactly
 * the "reasoner never writes code" guarantee the old handler enforced by never
 * spawning an agent at all. Every deterministic side effect stays in these hooks.
 *
 * Runs OUTSIDE the request lifecycle (scheduler tick / agent completion), so per
 * the AGENTS.md no-try/catch rule the dispatchers own the async boundary; these
 * stay defensive so a partial failure degrades to a recorded no-op.

  // legitimately proposes nothing gets. So "the agent emitted garbage" was
  // indistinguishable from "the agent correctly had nothing to propose", and the

  // field was reclassified; #4166 extends it to every supplied-but-unusable field
  // (`{"analysis": 7}`, a `pause` with no resolvable target), since
  // validateReasonerResponse now reports them all in `invalidFields`. A `null` field
  // is ABSENT, not malformed, so `proposal: null` stays the legitimate empty answer.
