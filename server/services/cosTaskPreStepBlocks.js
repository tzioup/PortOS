/**
 * CoS Task Pre-Step Blocks
 *
 * The prompt PRE-STEP layer of the CoS task generator: one resolver per
 * scheduled task type that runs a real pre-flight scan (branch reconcile, repo
 * sync, issue reconcile, reference-repo diff, `gh` PR poll), decides whether
 * the run is worth dispatching at all, and renders the Markdown block the agent
 * prompt is built around. Every resolver has the same shape —
 * `(app, taskType, metadata, taskSchedule) -> { skip, block, … }`, an empty
 * block for every type it does not own — plus the shared perpetual-drain brakes
 * (`applyPerpetualDrainCap`, `resolveReconcileDrainGate`), the static
 * prompt-fragment builders the claim prompts substitute (author filter, exclude
 * labels, swarm, plan constraint), and the token renderer
 * (`buildImprovementTaskDescription`) that assembles them into the final text.
 *
 * `cosTaskGenerator.js` composes these; the task-SELECTION engine
 * (`evaluateTasks`, the `spawnPriorityN*` ladder, the improvement/idle-review
 * generators) stays there. Split out because the two layers churn independently
 * and share nothing but the compose call.
 *
 * The `await import(...)` calls inside the resolvers are deliberate
 * cycle-avoidance for the pre-step services (branchReconcile / repoSync /
 * issueReconcile / referenceRepos / prWatcher) — not laziness. Do not convert
 * them to static imports.

  return `# ⚡ SWARM MODE — claim and ship up to ${n} independent issues in parallel

**This run operates in slashdo \`/do:next --swarm=${n}\` mode.** The single-issue framing in the task body below is your PER-AGENT playbook, not the shape of the whole run: instead of claiming ONE issue, claim up to ${n} *mutually independent* open issues and ship them concurrently, then serialize only the merges. Swarm adds exactly two things over the single-issue flow — a partition step up front and a serialized merge queue at the end; everything in between (claim, worktree, verify, implement, changelog, review gate) is the unchanged single-issue flow run once per agent. Never special-case a swarm agent's claim/ship logic.

**Swarm is issues-mode only.** If the resolved work tracker is not a forge issue tracker (no claimable open issues), ignore this section entirely and run the normal single-issue flow below.

## Phase A — Partition the batch (ONCE, up front)
1. Run Phase 1's candidate scan + in-flight filter (below) to build the eligible-issue queue (oldest-first, honoring the author filter).
2. From that queue pick up to ${n} issues that are **mutually independent** — no shared files/subsystems likely to collide on merge, no parent/child or dependency links; prefer issues that touch disjoint areas. **Under-fill is fine:** if fewer than ${n} independent issues exist, run a smaller swarm and say so. **If only ONE is eligible, just run the single-issue flow below and say so** — a one-agent swarm is pure overhead.

## Phase B — Fan out (one subagent per picked issue)
For EACH picked issue, spawn a subagent that runs the single-issue **Phases 2–6 below** for that one issue — claim (own \`claim/issue-<num>\` worktree + assignee + \`in-progress\` label) → verify → implement → run the LOCAL reviewers before anything is opened → changelog → open the ${pr} → run the ${pr}-side review gate ({reviewers}) — **but with NO merge and NO Phase 7 cleanup** (the orchestrator owns those; each agent opens its ${pr} the equivalent of \`--no-merge\`). Because each agent claims through the normal Phase 2 assignee marker + race read-back, two agents can never ship the same issue.

**Each fan-out agent gets its OWN scratch subdirectory — the scratchpad root is off-limits.** Every agent in this run shares one session scratchpad path, and every agent runs these byte-identical instructions, so left to themselves two agents pick the same obvious filename (\`pr-body.md\`) and silently clobber each other — last writer wins, the command still exits 0, and the wrong text lands on the wrong ${pr}. So: **each fan-out agent writes ALL temp files under \`<scratchpad>/issue-<num>/\` (its own issue number), and NEVER writes to the scratchpad root** (the root stays the orchestrator's). That covers ${pr} body drafts, review notes, diff dumps, test output — every scratch artifact, not just the body file. Create the directory before first use (\`mkdir -p\`). Filenames inside it may be as obvious as you like; the directory is what makes them unique. **If your environment gives you no scratchpad path at all**, use \`$(mktemp -d)/issue-<num>\` instead — never a path inside the source repo or inside your worktree, where it would show up as untracked cruft or get swept into a commit.

**Verify the ${pr} body's issue trailer after create AND after every edit.** The ${pr}-body flow is create-then-edit — the file is written once, then re-read minutes later during the review loop — which is a wide window for a stale or foreign body to land. Belt to the namespacing's braces: immediately after \`create\` and after each body \`edit\`, re-read the published body with \`${bodyCmd}\` — **note it takes no number: both CLIs resolve the ${pr} from your checked-out \`claim/issue-<num>\` branch, and passing an ISSUE number where a ${pr} number belongs is how you end up reading (and then "correcting") someone else's ${pr}** — and confirm the body carries this agent's own trailer. A full-scope ship MUST carry \`Closes #<num>\` for this issue; \`Refs #<num>\` is permitted ONLY for a deliberate partial ship that also records the required \`Done ✓ / Remaining ▢\` reconciliation comment. If it does not, rewrite the body from this agent's own scratch file and re-verify. **Cap this at 2 rewrites:** if the trailer still doesn't match, the scratch file itself is suspect — re-derive the body from your own branch's commits/diff for one final attempt, and if that also fails, STOP, leave the ${pr} open, and say so in the result you hand back. Never loop on it: Phase C waits for every agent to finish, so one agent stuck re-publishing blocks the whole batch's merges. And never assume a zero exit code means the right body was published.

## Phase C — Serialize the merges (orchestrator, after all agents finish)
Merge the ready ${pr}s ONE AT A TIME. For each: re-sync onto the latest default branch, gate on **required** CI (one re-run on a flaky required check, then proceed; a real failure or an irreconcilable conflict leaves that ${pr} OPEN and recorded — move to the next), then \`${mergeCmd}\`. After all merges, run Phase 7 cleanup once per merged worktree.

**Then — orchestrator only, ALWAYS, even though swarm work ships via ${pr}s with no working-tree change — write the completion sentinel** described in the **Completion Workflow** section below (write it at the EXACT sentinel path that section gives you — the filename carries your agent id — with a short run summary of the issues claimed + their ${pr}s + merge outcomes). Skip the \`/simplify\` and push/${pr} steps of that workflow (each fan-out agent already ran them), but the sentinel write is NOT optional: it is the ONLY signal that marks this CoS task complete and hands the orchestrator's summary back. A swarm run that ends without the sentinel leaves the task hanging as if it never finished.

Everything not covered above (claim mechanics, branch naming, verify/skip rules, implement conventions, ${pr} body, review loop) is exactly the single-issue flow documented below.
