/**
 * Agent Workspace Preparation
 *
 * Resolves the working directory an agent runs in and provisions any
 * isolation it needs before the agent is registered/spawned. Extracted from
 * `spawnAgentForTask` in agentLifecycle.js so that orchestrator stays
 * readable — this owns: workspace-path resolution, the pre-task git pull
 * (with conflict deferral), optional JIRA ticket + feature branch creation,
 * persistent feature-agent worktrees, and explicit/auto-detected worktree
 * creation.
 *
 * Side effects that don't touch spawn-local state (creating a conflict task,
 * flipping the task to pending/blocked, creating worktrees, mutating
 * `task.metadata` with JIRA fields) happen inline. Outcomes that the caller
 * must finish are returned as a discriminated result so the caller can fire
 * `cleanupOnError` + the matching `agent:deferred` / `agent:error` event:
 *
 *   { outcome: 'ready', workspacePath, resolvedAppName, worktreeInfo, jiraTicket, jiraBranchName, explicitWorktree }
 *   { outcome: 'deferred', reason, deferReason, branch }   // git conflict — task re-queued
 *   { outcome: 'blocked', reason }                          // explicit worktree requested but creation failed
 *                                                           // (`worktree-busy` blocks are a TIMED pause and revive themselves)
 *
 * An unexpected throw bubbles to the caller's widened try/catch the same way
 * the inline code did.
