/**
 * Track YouTube import (#1945) — download + extract just the audio track from
 * a YouTube URL via yt-dlp, land it in the shared music library (data/music/),
 * and create a Track record pointing at it.
 *
 * Mirrors the render.js / loraDatasetCaption.js job pattern: kickoff returns a
 * jobId immediately, the download runs detached, progress streams over the
 * shared SSE helpers, and the client attaches with useSseProgress. The yt-dlp
 * download+extract itself is the shared core in `ytdlpAudioImport.js` (reused
 * by the round reference-audio import #2120); this module owns the YouTube-only
 * URL scope, the music-library landing, and the Track creation.
