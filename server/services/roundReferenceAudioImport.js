/**
 * Round reference-audio import (#2120) — the deferred convenience path from the
 * reference-audio analysis feature (#2106). Download + extract the audio from a
 * reference URL (a layered TikTok performance, a YouTube clip, …) via yt-dlp and
 * land it in the uploads dir, so it can be attached to a round reference and
 * analyzed exactly like an uploaded file or a mic capture.
 *
 * Reuses the shared yt-dlp download core (`ytdlpAudioImport.js`) — same job/SSE
 * shape as the YouTube track import (#1945). The two differences from that path:
 *   1. URL scope — ANY public http(s) URL (SSRF-guarded), not YouTube-only. yt-dlp
 *      decides what it can actually extract; a scrape failure degrades to a clear
 *      error (upload/mic capture remain the primary attach paths).
 *   2. Output — lands in PATHS.uploads and returns a `filename` for the
 *      reference's `audioFilename`, rather than the music library + a Track.
