  // PR authorship (self / others / any). See server/services/prWatcher.js.
  'pr-watcher',
  // Programmatically scans new external issue comments and unreviewed external
  // PRs. Only replies and code-review judgments consume an agent; assignment,
  // review submission, rebase/CI policy enforcement, and merging are hooks.
  'issue-watcher',
  // Watches `referenceRepos` configured on the app — fetches each upstream
  // repo, finds commits since lastReviewedSha, and appends slug-tagged
  // `[ref-watch-…]` checklist items to the app's PLAN.md for `/claim` /
  // `plan-task` to pick up. No source-code edits, no separate review file.
  'reference-watch',
  // Walks the running app UI with a UX reviewer's eye (Playwright MCP) against a
  // named checklist — buried primary actions, dead-end empty/error states,
  // affordances that drift between sibling screens. Defaults to filing tracker
  // issues (`fileIssues: true`); the user can flip it to implement. Deliberately
  // narrower than its siblings: raw console errors belong to `ui-bugs`, viewport
  // breakage to `mobile-responsive`, ARIA/contrast/keyboard to `accessibility`.
  'ux',
  // Quota-burn `data-safety-audit` counterpart. Migrations, schema parity, and
  // cross-version compatibility. Defaults to file-issues (safer for unattended).
  'data-safety',
  // Quota-burn `simplify-audit` counterpart. Dead code, unused exports, and
  // copy-paste drift — distinct from `code-quality` (which is the broader DRY /
  // long-function / TODO pass). Defaults to file-issues.
  'simplify',
  // Structural-maintainability audit. Treats complexity thresholds as candidate
  // signals, then proves responsibility, reuse, or discoverability impact before
  // filing. Direct remediation is isolated in a managed worktree.
  'module-hygiene',
  // Quota-burn `api-contract-audit` counterpart. Route validation, client/server
  // drift, status envelopes, and missing `asyncHandler`. Defaults to file-issues.
  'api-contract',

  // and `accessibility`. Defaults to file-issues.
  'react-lifecycle',
  // Quota-burn `observability-audit` counterpart. Silent catches, log noise, and
  // errors logged without the context needed to reproduce them. Files under the
  // `code-quality` label. Defaults to file-issues.
  'observability',
  // Quota-burn `copy-audit` counterpart. User-facing wording only — jargon,
  // ambiguous action verbs, dead-end error text. Files under the `ux` label;
  // narrower than the `ux` audit, which walks the running UI. File-issues.
  'copy',
  // Audits `git stash list` for {appName} and drops entries already superseded
  // by (or a subset of) current `main`/HEAD, or that are stale/abandoned scratch
  // work — without discarding real unlanded work. On-demand only (no cadence
  // makes sense for something the user notices ad hoc); non-committing

  // Install-wide git hygiene sweep: for EVERY managed app (PortOS included) put
  // the checkout back on its default branch, level with origin both ways, with
  // no leftover local branches/worktrees and an empty stash list. A deterministic
  // Tier-1 pass in services/repoSync.js does everything provable with no LLM call
  // (push what is strictly ahead, fast-forward the default branch, return to it
  // when the current branch is clean + already merged, delegate merged-branch and
  // worktree deletion to branchReconcile, drop stashes whose content is identical
  // to the default branch). It dispatches ONE coordinator agent only when the
  // sweep leaves something needing judgment — a mid-flight merge/rebase,
  // uncommitted work, a diverged branch, unpushed commits with no PR, a stash it
  // could not prove redundant — or, under the default `verifyMode:
  // 'when-changed'`, to double-check a run that actually mutated something.
  // On-demand only, and GLOBAL: 'Run Now' with no app sweeps the whole install,
  // which is the shape the task exists for. Non-committing coordinator posture.
  'repo-sync',
  // The planning-only sibling of `feature-ideas`: runs the same brainstorm
  // research (PRD.md/GOALS.md or repository docs, changelog/git log, and

  // plan filed into the app's resolved work tracker via {trackerInstructions}
  // (PLAN.md checklist item / GitHub / GitLab issue / JIRA ticket), which the

  // (default) or queued CoS tasks. It never edits settings or schedules itself.
  // Install-wide: the ledger records PortOS-operator activity, not one managed
  // app's tree. Its buildTaskInput hook (userActionReviewHooks.js) skips the

  'user-action-review',
  // layered-intelligence is a PROGRAMMATIC-I/O task: it spawns a NORMAL reasoning
  // agent (visible in the CoS queue + Active Agents, TUI-attachable) with two

  // telemetry + open issues and builds the reasoning prompt; processTaskOutput
  // validates the agent's `.agent-done` payload, dedups, and files ONE tracker
  // issue. The agent runs in a THROWAWAY worktree (discardWorktree) that is never
  // committed/merged, so the reasoner still can't write code — the structured
  // payload is its only channel out. Scheduling (enabled/interval/provider/model)
  // lives in the per-app taskTypeOverrides; behavior (sources/scopes/rules/handoff)
  // stays in app.layeredIntelligence. Has NO DEFAULT_TASK_PROMPTS entry — the

// relabeled issue, a posted report — and by design produces no commit of its own.
// Two code-shipping criteria therefore have to be switched off or every SUCCESSFUL
// run is recorded as a failure:
//   * `useWorktree`/`openPR` — explicitly false (not merely absent) so
//     applyAppWorktreeDefault's `=== undefined` checks can't fill them from the
//     app's `defaultOpenPR`/`defaultUseWorktree`. A worktree these tasks never cd
//     into is at best unused and at worst harmful (it hides sibling refs the
//     reconcile scan must inspect), and the implied PR expectation fails the run at finalize
//     with `pr-missing` — there is no code to open a PR for. Locked in
//     MANAGED_AGENT_OPTIONS below so a per-app override can't re-attach them.
//     `readOnly: true` is NOT a substitute: it gates worktree CREATION
//     (agentWorkspacePrep.js) but the PR-claim check reads `metadata.openPR`
//     directly (agentTuiSpawning.js).
  //   * `worktreeChangesExpected` — a clean tree IS the success shape here, so the
  //     task's deliverable posture must record that this is not code work.

/**
 * Default `drainDispatchCap` for the reconcile drains: how many times a perpetual
 * drain may dispatch back-to-back before it is parked regardless of how much
 * progress it reports.
 *
 * The `lastActionableSignature` guard stops the drain only when a full cycle
 * changes NOTHING. It cannot stop a drain whose set keeps changing without ever
 * emptying — a branch that oscillates between two states, a coordinator that opens
 * a PR one run and closes it the next, a repo where new work arrives as fast as it
 * is finished. Those are indistinguishable from healthy progress one cycle at a
 * time, and on 2026-08-12 that shape ran ~40 coordinator agents between 05:19 and
 * 08:47 against the same two branches. So progress buys more cycles, not unlimited
 * ones: past the cap the drain parks until its recheck cadence, which is a delay,
 * never a dropped item — the branches are still there and the next recheck sees
 * them. Five is enough for a legitimately long drain (open PR → CI → merge →
 * cleanup) to finish a couple of branches per window.
 *
 * The count is very nearly "consecutive dispatches": every terminal park and every
 * manual re-run zero it. The one gap is a FAILED run — it neither refills nor
 * parks, so its spent dispatches carry into the next scheduled window and that
 * window caps early. It self-heals within one window (the next park zeroes it), and
 * erring toward capping early is the safe direction for a runaway guard.
 *
 * Why the cap is PER TYPE (`drainDispatchCap`) and not one global number: five is
 * ample for finishing branches (a handful per day) but would throttle a HEALTHY
 * claim-issue drain to five issues per recheck window — a real regression for a
 * drain the user relies on running productively overnight. So the claim drains
 * ship without the key at all (absent/`null` ⇒ unbounded, their work-detector's
 * idle park remains the only brake) and only the reconcile scans carry a number.
