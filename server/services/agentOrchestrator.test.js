/**
 * The facade is a re-export surface (#3450), so argument forwarding cannot fail —
 * `export { x } from './y.js'` is a binding alias, not a wrapper. What CAN fail
 * is the wiring: an alias pointed at the wrong leaf. `agentManagement.js` and
 * `cosAgentLifecycle.js` both export a function called `terminateAgent` and they
 * do completely different things — one emits `agent:terminate` and returns, the
 * other runs the real SIGTERM/SIGKILL sequence — so a copy-paste swap between
 * them is silent and severe. These assertions pin binding identity, which is the
 * property that actually holds, and pin the surface so the facade cannot quietly
 * regrow into a second barrel.
