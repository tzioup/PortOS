/**
 * CoS Task Generator Module
 *
 * The task-generation + evaluation engine extracted from cos.js. Owns:
 *  - `evaluateTasks` — the periodic/startup evaluation loop that decides what
 *    to spawn (priority 0 on-demand → 1 user → 2 auto-system → 3 mission/feature
 *    → 4 idle review) and emits `task:ready` for each pick.
 *  - the self-improvement / managed-app / idle-review generators that build the
 *    actual task objects (prompt template + metadata + confidence approval).
 *  - the PLAN.md in-flight pick helper (`applyPlanIdMetadata`) and the
 *    pipeline-precondition helpers (`checkStagePrecondition`,
 *    `shouldSkipForPrecondition`, `initializePipelineMetadata`,
 *    `applyAppWorktreeDefault`).
 *
 * The per-task-type prompt PRE-STEP layer (the deterministic scans, their
 * `{ skip, block }` resolvers, the drain brakes, and the token renderer) lives
 * in `cosTaskPreStepBlocks.js`; this module composes it.
 *
 * Self-contained — it imports only sibling services (no import back to cos.js).
 * `evaluateTasks` emits `task:ready` rather than spawning directly, so the
 * spawn-side scheduler (`dequeueNextTask`/`tryImmediateSpawn`) stays in cos.js.
 * The startup-skip flag is passed in as the `initialStartup` option rather than
 * read from cos.js module state, and the paused check reads state directly.

 *   - **Perpetual drains** (`metadata.perpetual`) — the work-detector park is the
 *     throttle (see `queueEligibleImprovementTasks` / agentCompletion.js). Without
 *     this, a perpetual task the refill just *queued* (after correctly bypassing
 *     the queue-path cooldown) would still be skipped here at the spawn gate,
 *     because the on-demand "Run" path stamped `lastReviewedAt` and these gates
 *     read it — so a manually-triggered perpetual drain stalls one item in.
 *   - **Quota burns** (`metadata.quotaBurnFamily`) — the throttle is the burn
 *     plan's own gate ladder: the reset-window horizon, the family's reserve, and
 *     `maxDispatchesPerWindow`, all checked before the task is ever queued. The
 *     app cooldown is re-stamped by EVERY completed task on that app, so on an app
 *     carrying any other recurring CoS work (a perpetual drain, which is itself
 *     exempt and therefore keeps completing) it never lapses — and the burn task
 *     sits in Pending until its window resets unspent, which is the exact outcome
 *     quota burn exists to prevent. (Tasks queued before this stamp existed are
 *     back-filled by migration 225, so the predicate reads metadata only.)
 *
 * `metadata.perpetual` is a bare boolean set upstream, but it round-trips through
 * COS-TASKS.md as the STRING `"true"` (taskParser serializes non-string/-object
 * metadata via `String(value)`; only arrays/objects like `pipeline` get the JSON
 * sentinel that preserves their type). So accept BOTH the in-memory boolean and
 * the re-parsed string — a `=== true` check alone would silently miss the
 * persisted-then-reloaded task, which is exactly the one the spawn gate sees.

 *   - Priority 0 — on-demand requests       (`spawnPriority0OnDemand`)
 *   - Priority 1 — pending user tasks        (`spawnPriority1UserTasks`)
 *   - Priority 2 — auto-approved system tasks (`spawnPriority2AutoApproved`)
 *   - Priority 3 — mission-driven tasks      (`spawnPriority3Missions`)
 *   - Priority 3.6 — due feature agents      (`spawnPriority36FeatureAgents`)
 *   - Priority 4 — idle review               (`spawnPriority4IdleReview`)
 *
 * Cross-cutting gates live here so they cover every tier uniformly: the
 * paused/daemon guard, the global slot cap, orphan-cooldown unblocking, and the
 * CoS auto-run + daily-budget gate (`resolveAutonomyBudget`). Priorities 0–1
 * spend against the global `availableSlots`; the autonomous tiers (2, 3, 3.6, 4)
 * spend against the lower `autonomousSlotCeiling` so the CoS action budget caps
 * them. `evaluateTasks` emits `task:ready` per pick; the spawn-side scheduler
 * (`dequeueNextTask`/`tryImmediateSpawn`) stays in cos.js.

 * `user-terminated` blocked tasks counted, so a task blocked by repeated
 * failures (max-retries, max-spawns, provider-config, unknown, …) was
 * invisible to dedup and the generator minted an identical duplicate every
 * cadence tick — nothing reaps blocked tasks, so the pile grew unbounded.
 * Failure-blocked *improvement* tasks (blocked with any category except
 * `user-terminated`, AND an analysis type is derivable) also count toward the
 * per-app cap — the retry path is unblocking the existing task, not creating
 * a new one. A blocked NON-improvement task (an investigation, a review
 * follow-up) never holds the app cap: blocked tasks are not reaped, so it
 * would freeze the app's improvement rotation forever. `user-terminated`
 * keeps its original scope (per-type slot only) so an intentional kill of
 * one type doesn't freeze the whole app's rotation either.
 *
 * `blockedTaskTypes` / `appsWithBlockedImprovement` are Maps (key → blocking
 * task id) mirroring which entries came from blocked tasks so the caller can
 * log a visible, actionable skip reason instead of silently suppressing
 * generation.
 *
 * `ignoreTaskId` excludes one task from every set — used by the perpetual
 * drain-on-completion refill, where the just-completed task is still
 * `in_progress` on disk (agent:completed fires before updateTask finalizes
 * it). Without it the completing task would make its own app look busy and
