/**
 * App port-config orchestration.
 *
 * Port fields in apps.json are *derived* from ecosystem.config.cjs (the source
 * of truth PM2 reads). This module diffs a submitted port update against the
 * ACTUAL config literals and persists the change back to the ecosystem config
 * (value-keyed remap for distinct ports; per-process/label targeted rewrite for
 * shared-value ports) in ONE atomic write. Extracted verbatim from the
 * `PUT /api/apps/:id` route so the route handler stays HTTP-thin — the caller
 * still owns the precondition guard (`usesPm2` + path exists) and the HTTP
 * error/response mapping.
 *
 * Returns `{ persistFailed, uiPortOverride, changedKeys }`:
 *   - persistFailed  — true when the user changed a port we could NOT write to
 *                      the source-of-truth config (caller should reject 422).
 *   - uiPortOverride — the derived uiPort to pin for served-by-API apps
 *                      (undefined when the app's ui port is a real literal).
 *   - changedKeys    — port keys that differed from the config (for context).
