/**
 * Federated peer-sync: per-record subscription store + event wiring.
 *
 * This file is the orchestrator + subscription CRUD + the debounced push
 * scheduler + the recordEvents / peer:online listeners. The three sync
 * protocols it used to inline now live in sibling modules (#1830 decomposed the
 * former 4,004-line god file):
 *   - `peerSyncShared.js`   — state machine, constants, peer-capability helpers
 *   - `peerSyncAssets.js`   — asset manifests + receiver-side asset pull
 *   - `peerSyncPush.js`     — outbound push pipeline
 *   - `peerSyncReceive.js`  — receiver-side push handler
 *   - `peerMediaLibrarySync.js` — standalone media-library sync
 *   - `peerCosSync.js`      — CoS history + tasks sync
 *
 * Their public surface is re-exported below so existing importers
 * (routes/peerSync.js, sharing/index.js, dataSync, the test suite, …) keep
 * working unchanged.
 *
 * Transport: pushes POST to the peer's `/api/peer-sync/push` (wired in
 * `server/routes/peerSync.js`) via `peerFetch`. Receiver pulls missing assets
 * back over the sender's `/data/{images,image-refs,videos}/` static mounts.
