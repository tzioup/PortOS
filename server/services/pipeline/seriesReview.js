/**
 * Pipeline — holistic "Review this series" flow (#2664).
 *
 * Composes the existing read-only review passes into ONE structured verdict the
 * user can act on: run the foundation judge + editorial checks + editorial
 * health/readiness + canon readiness, optionally route a free-text user
 * observation into an anchored finding, and return a single
 * `{ verdict: 'ready' | 'issues', foundation, health, canon, findings }` payload.
 *
 * This is a COMPOSITION layer — it reuses the existing runners verbatim and adds
 * no new AI plumbing and no second orchestrator:
 *   - foundation judge   → foundationJudge.judgeFoundation (writes only its own
 *                          snapshot; never touches the manuscript)
 *   - editorial checks   → editorial/checkRunner.runEditorialChecks (seeds the
 *                          shared manuscript-review store with findings — the
 *                          same store the fix path reads; NOT a manuscript write)
 *   - health/readiness   → editorialScore.getSeriesHealth
 *   - canon readiness    → canonReadiness.checkSeriesCanonReadiness (deterministic)
 *   - free-text feedback → routed through runStageScopedInlineLLM to the best
 *                          issue/section and seeded as an anchored finding
 *
 * The foundation judge and canon readiness are kicked off at entry and awaited
 * just before the verdict, so they overlap the editorial-checks pass (#4108).
 * The only hard ordering constraint is the seed→read chain feedback-seed →
 * checks-seed → health/getReview, which stays strictly sequential.
 *
 * The review performs NO manuscript writes, so it is safe to run repeatedly. The
 * FIX path is deliberately NOT here: "Fix these issues" drives the existing
 * Series Autopilot revision cycle (cos-domain gate + budget + SSE) and the
 * per-finding manuscriptFix routes — this service only produces the verdict.
 *
 * Progress streams over SSE via the shared `createSseRunner` (mirrors
 * checkRunner / editorialAnalysisRunner). The last verdict persists at
 * `data/pipeline-series-review/{seriesId}.json` so a (re)mounting client can
 * reload it without re-running.
 *
 * AI-provider policy: this fires ONLY from the explicit user "Review this
 * series" action — never at boot.
