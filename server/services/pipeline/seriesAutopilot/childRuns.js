 *
 * Each resolve runs in the resolver's `isolated` mode, because isolating the
 * FINDING was never enough to isolate the EDIT — see `isolatedCandidateRejection`

 *
 * `ledger` is the gate's shared mutation ledger: this pass holds its snapshot in
 * it and notes its own resolves, so a rejected attempt restores only the episode
 * synopses it actually wrote — and a RETAINED one is visible to a later rewind
 * in the round loop, which would otherwise have no record of it.
 *
 * Bounded by `attemptsLeft` and budget-gated per attempt like every other
 * resolve. Returns `{ accepted, attempts, verified }` — `verified` being the
 * full verification of the state now standing in the store, which the caller
 * hands to its next round instead of re-billing the identical call — plus
 * `outcome` when the run ended mid-pass.
 *
 * The pass banks its own rejections (#3829). `evidence` is the gate's
 * accumulator: read per target rather than once for the whole pass, so a patch
 * rejected on target 1 is evidence target 3 gets — and evidence the ordinary
 * resolve after a successful isolation gets too. Computing it once up front
