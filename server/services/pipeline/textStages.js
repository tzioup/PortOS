/**
 * Pipeline — Text Stage Execution
 *
 * Runs a single text stage (idea / prose / comicScript / teleplay) against the
 * active LLM provider. Builds the prompt via promptService.buildPrompt — each
 * stage has its own template in data.reference/prompts/stages/pipeline-*.md and
 * is registered in data.reference/prompts/stage-config.json.
 *
 * The render context includes the series bible (logline, premise, characters,
 * styleNotes) plus every *prior* stage's output, so downstream stages can
 * reference upstream content with `{{stages.idea.output}}` etc.
 *
 * Errors bubble (per project convention — no try/catch) except at the SSE
 * boundary in autoRunner.js, which routes failures through a finalizer.
 *
 * Progress (#3393): every phase of a run is broadcast through
 * `textStageProgress.js` so the UI shows attempt/judge progress instead of a
 * blind spinner. The channel is advisory — when nobody is subscribed every
 * emit is a no-op and generation is byte-for-byte the un-streamed path.

 * Scope the full-record character bible to the cast relevant to THIS issue (#1511).
 *
 * Injecting every canon character's full record into every issue's prose and
 * comic-script prompt is the token-bloat this addresses: a 68-character bible is
 * ~52K tokens re-sent on every issue × every stage, when most issues feature a
 * handful of the cast. We keep full records for: (a) the series PRINCIPALS (always
 * — the lead/recurring core is in play every issue), plus (b) any character the
 * issue's own source text names. The always-present compact `worldEntitiesSummary`
 * roster carries the rest of the cast for continuity refs.
 *
 * Two confidence tiers keep an incidental match from defeating the safety nets:
 *   - RELIABLE signals — the series principals (an unconditional FLOOR, so an
 *     incidental match can never SUPPRESS the leads) and full-name/alias matches.
 *   - WEAK signal — the first-name supplement, which errs toward inclusion (a
 *     common-word token like "will" in "the team will regroup" can spuriously
 *     match "Will Stone"). It only ADDS to an already-reliable scope; it never
 *     counts as the signal that suppresses the whole-cast fallback.
 *
 * So when there is NO reliable signal (no principals tagged AND no full-name
 * match — e.g. an untagged early-bible cast), the result is the whole cast, even
 * if a first-name token happened to match: better to ship the full bible than to
 * let "will" scope the prompt down to "Will Stone" and drop everyone else. The
 * block is therefore never empty.
 *
 * Precision guard (#1529): a character whose own name IS a common word (a cast
 * member literally named "Will"/"May"/"Grace") would otherwise match incidentally
 * via the case-insensitive full-name matcher and count as reliable — scoping the
 * issue down to that one character. The reliable-signal matcher (`matchReliableNames`)
 * therefore requires a SINGLE-WORD name to appear in its capitalized form, so "the
 * team will regroup" no longer counts as naming a character called "Will", while
 * "Will entered" still does. Multi-word names and aliases keep the case-insensitive
 * match. Residual: a sentence-initial capital ("Will the team…") still matches, but
 * that's the safe over-inclusion direction (the character keeps its full record) —
 * and even a true miss is non-lossy, since the uncapped `worldEntitiesSummary` roster
 * still carries every un-scoped character's one-line continuity entry.
