/**
 * Scheduled handler `universe-bible-describe` — fill in the blanks on universe
 * bible entries that are named but not actually described.
 *
 * PROGRAMMATIC: no agent is spawned. PortOS sends one headless expand prompt per
 * entry through the stage runner. Run from CoS → Schedule it uses the task's own
 * provider pin (or, unpinned, the install's active provider, like any other
 * task); run as a Quota Burn step it is pinned to the burning family's own
 * CLI/TUI provider, so a `codex` burn spends CODEX's subscription window. Both
 * paths go through this one implementation — see `scheduledHandlers/index.js`.
 *
 * This is the step that belongs BEFORE `universe-bible-images` in a plan: an
 * image rendered from a character row holding only a name is a generic figure
 * that has to be thrown away, and it has already spent the image quota. Order
 * the two jobs describe→images in the family's rotation (and optionally set the
 * image job's `requireDescribed`) and the backlog gets described first, then
 * rendered from something worth rendering.
 *
 * "Not described" is `lib/universeBibleCompleteness.js`'s definition, at the
 * depth the job selects:
 *   - `core` — the entry is unusable without these (a character's
 *     physicalDescription / personality / background / motivations / visualNotes;
 *     a place's or object's description).
 *   - `full` — the whole sheet, which for a character is every field the
 *     character-sheet expand prompt fills.
 *
 * Category variations and composite sheets are deliberately out of scope: their
 * sanitizer already REQUIRES a prompt, so one cannot exist undescribed.
