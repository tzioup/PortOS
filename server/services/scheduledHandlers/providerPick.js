/**
 * An agent-capable provider in the burning family. A job's explicit
 * `providerId` wins; otherwise match the family id against the enabled
 * providers, PREFERRING the type named by `prefer` (default `tui`).
 *
 * Preferring the TUI is the point for an AGENT burn: it runs unattended for
 * minutes on the user's own subscription, and a TUI agent is watchable in Active
 * Agents and can be steered mid-run, where a headless CLI run can only be read
 * after it has finished. Most families have both registered (`claude-code` +
 * `claude-code-tui`, `codex` + `codex-tui`, …) and the CLI sorts first, so a
 * plain `find` silently picked the unobservable one every time.
 * `pickScrapeProvider` applies the same preference when reading `/usage`.
 *
 * A PROGRAMMATIC job passes `prefer: 'cli'` instead: it sends one headless
 * prompt through the stage runner, with no agent session to watch or steer, so
 * the TUI's observability buys nothing and its interactive startup is pure
 * overhead. The other type is still accepted as a fallback — a family with only
 * a TUI registered must not silently stop burning.
 *
 * Two exclusions, both about what a burn is FOR — spending a subscription window
 * that would otherwise expire unused:
 * - API-type providers bill per token rather than drawing down a window.
 * - Local-runtime wrappers run a LOCAL model, so there is no window to spend and
 *   burning through one accomplishes nothing. `resolveEnabledFamilies` drops
 *   them from the quota cards for exactly this reason; a `claude-ollama-tui`
 *   would otherwise be a perfectly good match for the `claude` family.

 * `antigravity-cli` / `antigravity-tui`, neither of which contains "agy", so a
 * configured Antigravity burn plan reported "no enabled CLI/TUI provider" and
 * could never dispatch — while the quota card sat right above it showing a
 * healthy window, because `providerUsage`'s own matcher checks the command.
 *
 * The id substring stays as a fallback for a provider registered under a wrapper
 * script whose basename isn't the family name.
 *
 * Exported because `providerForFamily` deliberately honors an explicit
 * `providerId` pin without re-checking it — a caller that must refuse an
 * out-of-family pin (`quotaBurnInvoke.js`, where the pin would spend the wrong
 * subscription) asks this directly rather than re-deriving the rule.
