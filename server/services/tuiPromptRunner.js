/**
 * One-shot TUI prompt runner.
 *
 * Spawns a TUI binary (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, etc.) in a PTY, waits for
 * the prompt cursor to become input-ready, bracketed-pastes the prompt + Enter,
 * watches for the model response to complete via sustained output-idle, then
 * strips ANSI and returns the captured text. Persists a run record under
 * `data/runs/<runId>/` so /runs can replay TUI invocations alongside CLI/API.
 *
 * Distinct from `server/services/agentTuiSpawning.js` — that path wraps
 * long-running CoS agents (worktree, /simplify, /do:pr, .agent-done sentinel).
 * This is the synchronous "send prompt, get text back" variant the central
 * promptRunner needs when `provider.type === 'tui'`.
 *
 * Spawning bypasses `services/shell.js` deliberately:
 *   - shellService caps interactive sessions, which the central handler can
 *     exceed easily (arc planner fans out parallel calls). We still *register*
 *     the spawned PTY as an external view afterward (see below) — that path is
 *     exempt from the cap, so surfacing the run doesn't re-introduce the limit.
 *   - shellService wraps a login shell around the TUI; pasting `${cmd}\n`
 *     into a zsh prompt is slower and noisier than spawning the TUI directly.
 *
 * Completion detection, in priority order: the model's response-file write
 * is the authoritative "done" signal (the wrapped prompt directs it to write
 * its full answer to `tui-response.txt` and then finish) — checked
 * unconditionally, even while a human watches. Output-idle is the fallback for
 * TUIs that print inline instead of writing the file (paused while watched, so
 * a viewer isn't snapped shut mid-read). Codex is excluded from that fallback:
 * its status chrome can go silent for long stretches during real reasoning,
 * and the required response file is the only safe completion signal. The hard
 * timeout is the backstop, and salvages an already-written file before failing.
 * Per-binary input-prompt
 * regexes were considered for idle but are fragile across versions and screen
 * sizes; for non-Codex TUIs, the idle threshold (~8s) remains the pragmatic
 * inline-output fallback.

/**
 * Run a single prompt through a TUI provider. Mirrors the signature of
 * `executeCliRun` / `executeApiRun` so the central handler treats all three
 * branches uniformly (a single options object).
 *
 * Caller (typically `runPromptThroughProvider`) owns the run record:
 *   - `createRun` (toolkit) writes the initial metadata.json + prompt.txt
 *   - this function writes output.txt and finalizes metadata.json on exit
 *     via `runner.js#finalizeRunRecord`, so /runs shows TUI runs with the
 *     same success/exitCode/duration shape as CLI runs.
 *
 * @param {object} options
 * @param {string} options.runId — pre-created run id (from createRun).
 * @param {object} options.provider — { id, type: 'tui', command, args, envVars,
 *   tuiPromptDelayMs?, tuiOneShotIdleMs?, timeout?, defaultModel? }. The
 *   model passed to `--model` is taken from `provider.defaultModel`; per-
 *   call overrides are applied by the central handler via a provider clone
 *   before this function is reached.
 * @param {string} options.prompt — full text to paste into the TUI.
 * @param {string} options.workspacePath — working directory for the spawned TUI.
 * @param {(chunk: string) => void} [options.onData] — incremental ANSI-stripped
 *   output stream.
 * @param {(meta: object) => void} [options.onComplete] — fired after exit with
 *   `{ exitCode, duration, success, error?, model? }`. Promise resolves
 *   AFTER this fires.
 * @param {number} [options.timeout] — hard cap on a single run (ms). Falls back to
 *   `provider.timeout`, then `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS`.
 * @param {number} [options.idleMs] — response-complete idle threshold (ms) for
 *   THIS call, overriding `provider.tuiOneShotIdleMs` and the 8s default. The
 *   default suits a chatty text reply that goes quiet within seconds; a task
 *   that streams sparse output during a long operation (e.g. a multi-minute
 *   grok `image_to_video` render) needs a larger value so a mid-work lull isn't
 *   mistaken for completion. Pair with a larger `timeout`.
 * @param {string} [options.label] — human label for the live Shell view (the
 *   run `source`, e.g. `'pipeline-manuscript-completeness'`). Surfaced in the
 *   Shell page's session tab; falls back to `command · model` when absent.
 * @param {boolean} [options.guard=false] — prepend the PM2 guard shim for an
 *   autonomous task that must not be able to kill the shared PortOS daemon.
 * @param {boolean} [options.reportFailure=true] — fire the host's `onRunFailed`
 *   hook when the run fails. Pass `false` for a deliberate PROBE of a provider
 *   (the local-model benchmark): its failure is the caller's measurement, which
 *   it reports itself, not a provider incident for the autofixer to escalate.
 * @returns {Promise<void>}
