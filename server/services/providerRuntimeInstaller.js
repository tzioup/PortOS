/**
 * Provider runtime (CLI) availability and installation.
 *
 * A CLI/TUI provider is only as usable as the binary it shells out to, so the
 * AI Providers page asks this module "is `codex` runnable, and can PortOS
 * install it for you?" per provider card. Generalized from the OpenCode-only
 * installer (#4143 follow-up) so every provider whose runtime PortOS can
 * install gets the same small status + Install affordance instead of one
 * hard-coded banner for OpenCode.
 *
 * The Providers page owns the user gesture; this module exposes only a fixed
 * per-runtime invocation from the table below, never a user-supplied package,
 * URL, or command. A request names a runtime *id* — anything not in the table
 * is rejected before a child is spawned — which keeps the install surface as
 * narrow as the agent runner's command allowlist while letting a missing CLI
 * become self-service.
 *
 * The binary each row installs comes from `PROVIDER_VENDORS` rather than a
 * second hand-typed list of CLI names (#3618's rule — one vendor row, not N
 * copies); `providerRuntimeInstaller.test.js` fails if a vendor ever lands
 * there without an install row here.
 *
 * Install kinds:
 *   - `npm`    — one fixed `npm install --global <package>`.
 *   - `script` — the vendor's own published POSIX install script, piped to bash
 *                (the same shape `localLlm.js` uses for Ollama on Linux). This
 *                *is* remote code by design: it's the install path these two
 *                vendors publish, and no request value reaches the command. Not
 *                offered on Windows, where they ship a separate PowerShell
 *                script PortOS deliberately does not run for the user.
 *
 * Ollama and LM Studio are deliberately absent: the Models → LLMs page owns
 * their install (it also starts the service afterwards, and knows that a macOS
 * app bundle with no `lms` shim still counts as installed). The Providers page
 * links there for those two instead of re-probing them here.
