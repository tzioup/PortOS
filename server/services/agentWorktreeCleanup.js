/**
 * Agent Worktree Cleanup
 *
 * Post-completion worktree handling for agents: merge-or-PR the worktree
 * branch, drive the multi-reviewer review-loop follow-up, and auto-create
 * recovery tasks when a merge or PR creation fails. Extracted from
 * agentLifecycle.js as a self-contained leaf so the completion-cleanup
 * orchestrator (agentCompletionCleanup.js) can import it without a circular
 * dependency back into agentLifecycle.js.
 *
 * agentLifecycle.js re-exports these three functions for backward
 * compatibility (agentManagement.js and subAgentSpawner.js import
 * `cleanupAgentWorktree` / `spawnMergeRecoveryTask` / `spawnReviewLoopFollowUp`
 * from there).

// mid-`git worktree remove --force`, saw the in-progress deletions as ` D <path>`

// worktree that removed cleanly milliseconds later — a false warning AND a false

/**
 * Clean up a worktree for a completed agent.
 * Reads worktree metadata from the agent's registered state and removes the worktree.
 * `prCreation` (see `PR_CREATION`) decides who opens the change request:
 * `'always'` pushes and creates one instead of auto-merging; `'if-missing'` does
 * that only when the forge confirms the agent — which owned its own PR workflow —
 * opened none (#3733); `'never'` leaves it entirely to the agent.
 * `prCompletion` decides whether the PR is reviewed then merged, merged after
 * green CI, or intentionally left open. The explicit leave-open policy does
 * not spawn a post-PR agent.
 * `reviewers` is the ordered reviewer list (e.g. `[codex, antigravity, copilot]`); the native
 * GitHub Copilot review is pre-requested here only when copilot LEADS the list (otherwise
 * the follow-up requests it at its turn so Copilot sees the post-fix diff). `reviewStopMode`
 * (`all`/`on-findings`/`on-clean`) and `reviewerApplies` are threaded into the follow-up's
 * metadata. CLI reviewers (claude/antigravity/codex/grok) are always driven by the follow-up agent,
 * which works on any forge; copilot is GitHub-only and dropped on non-GitHub remotes.
 * When skipMerge is true (review-loop follow-up agents), the cleanup never auto-merges
 * the worktree branch into the source workspace because `gh pr merge` already handled it.
 * Otherwise, merges the worktree branch back to the source branch on success.
 *
 * Re-entrant per `agentId`: a second call that arrives while the first is still
 * running joins it and resolves with the SAME warnings rather than starting a
 * competing pass (see `inFlightCleanups`). The joiner's `options` are therefore
 * ignored — one completing agent gets one cleanup, and the two duplicate callers
 * this guards against derive their options from the same task metadata anyway.

/**
 * What, if anything, should a retry of this task pick up from the run that just
 * died? Called after cleanup has decided what to preserve, so the answer reflects
 * what's actually on disk rather than what we hoped.
 *
 * Two shapes of leftover work, in priority order:
 *
 *   1. **Adopt the worktree** — `{ branchName, worktreePath }`. The dead agent's
 *      own worktree survived cleanup (a dirty tree aborts removal) and is still on
 *      its branch. This is the shape a server restart leaves behind: the run is
 *      killed mid-edit, so its work is UNCOMMITTED and no branch pointer can carry
 *      it. The retry moves that tree to its own directory (see `adoptWorktree`).
 *   2. **Attach the branch** — `{ branchName, worktreePath: null }`. The worktree
 *      is gone but the branch survived with unmerged commits, so a fresh worktree
 *      attaches to it via `createWorktree`'s `existingBranch` path.
 *
 * Returns null when there is nothing to resume — no branch, no leftover work, or
 * a branch whose commits already landed. A null answer means "start clean", the
 * correct behavior for an agent that died before producing anything.
 *
 * Deliberately checks the LOCAL branch: `removeWorktree` preserves it in place,
 * and `createWorktree`'s `existingBranch` path prefers a local copy before
 * falling back to `origin/<branch>`, so a local-only branch resumes fine.
 *
 * @param {string} sourceWorkspace - the parent git repository
 * @param {string} branchName - the dead agent's worktree branch
 * @param {string} [worktreePath] - the dead agent's worktree directory, the
 *   adoption candidate. Omit to consider only the branch-attach shape.
 * @returns {Promise<{branchName: string, worktreePath: string|null}|null>}

 *
 * A failed agent whose branch — or whole worktree — survived cleanup leaves real
 * work behind (see `preserveBranchWithCommits` above; a dirty tree aborts removal
 * outright). Recording where it lives on the TASK is what makes its retry RESUME
 * rather than restart from scratch — the behavior the agent-d2ae0352 incident
 * exposed, where a run reaped 30s after its PR merged was re-dispatched to a fresh
 * agent that began the shipped work over.
 *
 * Call this AFTER `cleanupAgentWorktree` so it reflects what actually survived, and
 * from all three spawn sites — `spawnDirectly` (agentCliSpawning.js), the TUI
 * `finish()` (agentTuiSpawning.js), and `handleAgentCompletion`
 * (agentCompletionCleanup.js, runner mode). Only the runner path used to do it, so a
 * failed direct-CLI/TUI run left a branch full of commits nothing would ever point a
 * retry at.
 *
 * Only for a task that is actually going to RETRY. The failure verdict has already
 * been persisted by `finalizeAgent` at this point, and a retryable failure leaves
 * the task HELD — `in_progress` plus the retry-hold marker (#3373,
 * lib/taskRetryHold.js) — precisely so nothing can dequeue it during the cleanup
 * this call follows. Releasing the hold and writing the pointer is therefore ONE
 * `updateTask`: the task becomes spawnable and pointed in the same write, never
 * spawnable-then-pointed. A `blocked` task that exhausted its budget carries no
 * hold and gets no pointer — dead metadata `updateTask` would strip again on the
 * next terminal write, and that a later `reviveBlockedTask` would resurrect as a
 * live pointer to a branch nobody vetted.
 *
 * The no-hold fallback (a task we read as plain `pending`) still writes the pointer
 * alone: that is the pre-#3373 shape, and it is also what a task the orphan sweep
 * already recovered mid-cleanup looks like. Anything else we read — `blocked`,
 * `in_progress` under someone else's hold or none at all (the retry already
 * spawned), a failed read, a task deleted mid-run — is not evidence of a retry we
 * own, so we write nothing.
 *
 * `agentMetadata` is optional: pass it when the caller already holds the agent
 * record (the runner path does), omit it and this reads the record itself —
 * `getAgentRecord`, not `getAgent`, so it doesn't read and line-split the run's
 * whole output.txt for three metadata fields. `undefined` means "not supplied" —
 * a caller that genuinely has no metadata still gets the no-op it deserves, since
 * `resolveTaskResumePatch` bails on a non-worktree run.
