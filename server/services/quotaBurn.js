/**
 * Quota-burn candidate selection + the per-window dispatch ledger.
 *
 * Quota-burn spends subscription-backed CLI quota that would otherwise expire
 * unused: it watches each enabled provider family's reset clock and, only once
 * a window is close to resetting and still has headroom above the family's
 * reserve, runs the next job in that family's ordered burn plan.
 *
 * This module owns the SELECTION half (which family, which window, is the
 * window's dispatch cap spent) and nothing else. The plan lives in
 * `quotaBurnStore.js`, the shared invocation path in `quotaBurnInvoke.js`, and the loop that ties
 * them together in `quotaBurnRunner.js`.
 *
 * Everything here fails CLOSED: an unknown reset time, an unsupported provider,
 * a quota-read error, or a card that declares itself unburnable all mean "do not
 * dispatch". Burning is opt-in spending of the user's own subscription — a
 * guess in the permissive direction costs them real quota.
