/**
 * Everything PortOS does TO the vLLM Qwen3.8-27B compose project.
 *
 * `lib/vllmQwenProject.js` reads what is on disk and `lib/vllmQwenProvision.js`
 * decides what the `.env` must say; this module is the side of it that runs
 * commands — the same split `mtplxServerManager.js` and `llamaServerManager.js`
 * have from `localRuntimeSetup.js`, whose registry stays a table of rows rather
 * than growing one runtime's orchestration inline.
 *
 * Two things it does and nothing else does:
 *
 *   - **Provision** (`provisionVllmQwenProject`) — clone, write `.env`, build,
 *     prepare. This is the ~30 GB, and it runs ONLY behind the checklist's
 *     `provision-start` action, whose button names the payload before the click.
 *     `install()` in the registry still refuses: Docker Desktop, the NVIDIA
 *     Container Toolkit and WSL2 are host-level operator decisions with driver
 *     requirements PortOS cannot judge. This provisions the PROJECT on a host
 *     that is already capable of running it.
 *   - **Start** (`startVllmQwenProject`) — `docker compose up` on a project that
 *     is demonstrably prepared, and a refusal naming the fix on anything else.
 *
 * Neither ever throws: both run from an SSE route whose headers are already
 * flushed, so every failure comes back as a value the caller turns into a
 * terminal frame.
