/**
 * Quota-burn runner — the single install-level loop.
 *
 * ONE loop lives in PortOS (not one scheduled task per managed app, which is
 * what this replaced): every `checkIntervalMinutes` it reads the burn plan,
 * takes a zero-token quota reading, and — only when a family's window is inside
 * its reset horizon with headroom above its reserve — runs the next job in that
 * family's ordered plan that reports pending work.
 *
 * The interval only STARTS a family's burn. Once a job is out, each finished burn
 * agent triggers a fresh evaluation of that family (`onBurnAgentCompleted`), so
 * the plan is walked one agent at a time until a gate closes — the window's
 * dispatch cap, the reserve, or the reset horizon.
 *
 * "Next job" is literal — the walk resumes after the family's last dispatch
 * rather than restarting at the top (`rotatePlanAfter`), so an N-job plan cycles
 * through all N instead of re-running job #1 every time.
 *
 * At most one dispatch per FAMILY per cycle. Families do not share a budget:
 * each one draws down its own subscription window, against its own reserve and
 * its own `maxDispatchesPerWindow`. Stopping the whole cycle after the first
 * dispatch (which is what this used to do) therefore didn't protect anything —
 * it just meant the soonest-resetting family took every cycle, and a family with
 * a longer window never burned at all while it was enabled. A `claude` window
 * resetting in 2h beat an `agy` window resetting in 21h on every single tick, so
 * the agy plan sat at "93% left · 0/5 used" indefinitely.
 *
 * AI-policy posture (AGENTS.md): this is a sanctioned scheduled automation —
 * disabled by default, armed only by an explicit opt-in on the Quota Burn page,
 * where the family, provider, model, and work are all named before anything
 * runs. Boot ARMS the interval; it never dispatches. With `enabled: false` the
 * tick returns before reading quota, so a fresh install is silent.
 *
 * Everything fails CLOSED and nothing here throws into the timer: a probe that
 * errors, a job that declines, or an unreadable config all end the cycle with a
 * logged reason instead of charging a dispatch or crashing the process.
 *
 * ACCOUNTING happens on acceptance, not on dispatch. The two synchronous lanes
 * (a programmatic handler, a custom job) are accepted the moment they return, so
 * this file charges them itself. A reference step goes out as an on-demand
 * REQUEST an engine may still refuse, so it takes a reservation instead — which
 * counts against the window cap and blocks a second dispatch of the same step
 * until `quotaBurnAcceptance.js` settles it into exactly one charge, or releases
 * it uncharged. Each cycle settles the previous one's requests before deciding
 * what to ask for next.
