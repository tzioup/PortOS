 * provider-specific error token) rather than the loose regex sweep over agent
 * output. When the same regex mixes a structured alternative with a loose
 * keyword alternative (e.g. `API Error: 429` vs a bare `rate limit`), a
 * `structuredMarker` sub-pattern gates the promotion: the structured `origin`
 * is only honored when the marker is present in the matched text; otherwise the
 * match is treated as `'output-scan'` (see `resolvePatternOrigin`). Patterns
 * with no `origin` are always `'output-scan'`. Task-learning's environmental
 * exclusion (metrics.js) diverts only non-`output-scan` failures, so a failing
 * test whose tail prints "rate limit" is NOT misread as an infra outage.
