// without this the drawer would show a ready button for a job that dies minutes
// later. Cache-only by construction — `inspectModelCache` reads the local HF
// cache and never fetches, which is what keeps the plan endpoint read-only.
//
// The HOST is a fourth axis (#6537), and the only one no download can satisfy:
// the registry declares what a pack needs of the machine (`ltx25_cuda_distilled`
// asks for 64 GB of system memory), and a host below that floor cannot run it
// for an upscale either — an upscale renders at twice the source's linear
// dimensions, so it sits strictly ABOVE a plain render's peak. Without it the
// plain render is refused up front with a stated reason while the upscale queues
// a GPU job that dies seconds later inside the runtime's own loader, which is
// exactly the "ready button for a job that dies minutes later" this axis exists
// to prevent. Found on a 32 GB / RTX 3090 Windows host, where the pack's 26 GB
// text encoder cannot be mapped a second time and both LTX-2.5 CUDA runners die
// identically in `ltx_core`'s safetensors loader.
//
// The plan reports the server's `hardwareCompatibility` ANNOTATION rather than a
// flattened boolean, exactly as every other model payload does, so the consumers
// (`enqueueLtxUpscale`, the drawer) share one predicate — `isHardwareCompatible`
// — instead of each re-deriving the tri-state rule. It stays independent of
// `cached`: a pack can be fully downloaded onto a host that cannot run it, and
// reporting that as "not downloaded" would send someone to re-fetch 72 GB that
