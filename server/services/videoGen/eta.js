/**
 * Video Gen — history-calibrated render ETA.
 *
 * Local video renders run 15–40+ minutes. The child emits step progress but no
 * wall-clock estimate, so the UI can only say "step 7/30" for half an hour.
 * This module turns the render history into an estimate using nothing but the
 * install's own measured runs — no hand-tuned constants, no per-chip table.
 *
 * The model, in order of preference:
 *
 *   1. **Measured** — records of the *same shape* (same model + width × height ×
 *      numFrames × steps) already exist. A real measurement always beats a
 *      model, so the median of those durations is the answer outright.
 *   2. **Linear fit** — same model, differing shapes. Render cost is very close
 *      to `a · (pixels × frames × steps) + b`: the sampler work scales with the
 *      product, while `b` is the fixed cost paid once per render (weight load,
 *      text encode, VAE decode, mux). Least-squares over the recent same-model
 *      records recovers both. `b` is what makes chained renders estimable —
 *      an N-chunk chain pays it N times, not once.
 *   3. **Proportional** — too few / too degenerate a sample set to separate the
 *      fixed cost, so fall back to the median ms-per-work-unit with no
 *      intercept.
 *   4. **No estimate** — nothing usable in history. Returns `null`, an explicit
 *      absent sentinel. Never a fabricated number and never `0`: a caller that
 *      showed "0s remaining" for an unmeasured model would be lying, and a
 *      fresh install has no measurements by definition.
 *
 * Everything here is pure — `history` is passed in, never read from disk.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT in the shape key: mode (t2v / i2v / fflf / extend) and
 * LoRAs. They do move render cost, but folding them in would fragment an
 * install's already-small sample set into buckets too thin to fit — and the
 * resulting variance is ordinary estimate noise, whereas an over-narrow key
 * produces "no estimate" for renders we could have called within a minute.

 * predate it (and non-render entries like downloaded videos) simply have no
 * measurement and are excluded rather than guessed at.
 *
 * The speed profile is part of the sample key — unlike mode and LoRAs, which
 * the module docblock explains are deliberately left out. The difference is
 * magnitude and shape: a profile swaps the whole schedule (CFG 1.0 drops the
 * negative branch, stage 2 runs fewer steps, TeaCache skips residuals), so it
 * moves the COST CURVE's slope rather than adding variance around it. Pooling
 * the two buckets would systematically over-estimate every fast render and
 * under-estimate every quality one — a confidently wrong number, which this
 * module treats as strictly worse than no number at all. The cost is that the
 * first renders on a newly-picked profile have no estimate, which is exactly
 * what a newly-added model already does.
 *
 * A render whose profile partly degraded (the runner couldn't apply TeaCache,
 * say) still lands in its requested bucket: degradation is rare, surfaced to
 * the user at render time, and ordinary variance next to the slope difference
 * this split exists to capture.

/**

 * sail through the filter below. Each is a derived record that inherits its
 * source's model and dials while measuring something else entirely:
 *
 *  - `upscaledFrom` — the row keeps the source's `steps`/`numFrames` but DOUBLES
 *    width and height (4× the work units), while its duration is an ffmpeg 2×
 *    pass measured in seconds. Large x, tiny y: the single worst sample the
 *    least-squares fit could be handed.
 *  - `federatedPeerId` — rendered on a PEER's hardware, and the span includes
 *    submission, that peer's own queue wait, download and verification. It
 *    describes the federation round-trip, not this machine's throughput.
 *  - `chainedFrom` / `stitchedFrom` — the chain's chunk rows are themselves
 *    timed samples, so the stitched total would double-count them.
 *
 * Keyed on the discriminators the rows already carry rather than on a tag the
 * writers have to remember to set: a future derived-record path is excluded the
 * moment it stamps one of these, and until then the estimator is the one place
 * that decides what a valid sample is.
