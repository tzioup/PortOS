/**
 * Programmatic-I/O hooks per scheduled task type.
 *
 * Most scheduled task types are `prompt → agent → wait for the .agent-done
 * sentinel`. A few need PROGRAMMATIC steps around the agent. A hook module may
 * export either or both of:
 *
 *   - `buildTaskInput({ app, taskType, ignoreTaskId })` — runs BEFORE spawn, inside
 *     the task generator. Collects data beyond the base prompt (telemetry, open
 *     issues, …) and returns `{ prompt?, providerId?, model?, hookMetadata?, skip? }`.
 *     `ignoreTaskId` is set on the drain-on-completion refill and names the task
 *     that just finished but is still `in_progress` on disk — a hook that counts
 *     in-flight work must exclude it:
 *       • `prompt`     — a fully-rendered prompt that REPLACES the template.
 *       • `providerId` / `model` — pin the agent's provider/model (per-app choice).
 *       • `hookMetadata` — a free-form bag merged into the task's persisted
 *         `metadata`, so a value resolved pre-agent survives to `processTaskOutput`.
 *         The generator applies it only AFTER every gate that can still skip task
 *         creation has passed, so a hook can safely defer a side effect until the
 *         task really exists (a spend ledger, say — #3179) instead of
 *         performing it speculatively here. Untyped by design — a passthrough, not
 *         a schema; keep the keys namespaced to the task type. A key that collides
 *         with generator-computed metadata is DROPPED with a warning, so the bag
 *         can't overwrite `analysisType`, provider pins, or plan ids.
 *       • `skip: { reason }` — short-circuit: no agent is spawned.
 *
 *   - `processTaskOutput({ appId, success, payload, workspacePath, agentId, task }, deps?)`
 *     — runs AFTER the agent finishes, from the finalize chokepoint. `payload` is
 *     the parsed `.agent-done` sentinel payload (the agent's structured output);
 *     the hook does deterministic work on it (e.g. filing a tracker issue) and
 *     returns an outcome. `deps` is an injectable seam for tests.
 *
 *   - `isTaskOutputPayload(payload)` — pure shape check for that hook's own
 *     deliverable. Optional, but a type that omits it forfeits the transcript
 *     rescue for a payload the model printed instead of writing (#3640).
 *
 * The agent itself runs through the NORMAL path (visible in the CoS queue +
 * Active Agents, TUI-capable), so a programmatic-I/O task differs from any other
 * scheduled task only in these two slots. See
 * docs/plans/2026-07-09-programmatic-io-scheduled-tasks.md.
 *
 * Hook modules are lazy-imported (their dependency graphs are heavy) and resolved
 * by task type. `HOOK_MODULES` is the single registration point; a new
 * programmatic-I/O task type adds one entry here plus a module that exports the
 * hook(s) above. An entry may set `input: false` when input is owned by an
 * earlier coordinator phase but the type still needs an output hook. The
 * resolvers return `null` for any unregistered type without importing anything,
 * so a normal task type pays ~zero cost.

 * (no worktree, no PR), so they DO have a workspacePath at finalize, and the task-id commit
 * commit criterion would score every SUCCESSFUL run as a failure and pin their learning

 * (fixing tasks, /claim flows, or a triage that commits PLAN.md), so their commit
 * criterion is real and must stay — exempting them would MASK genuine failures. Only
 * complete tasks whose DEFAULT contract is structurally no-commit belong here.
 *
 * pr-watcher is intentionally excluded on a different axis: it is a review-of-others'-PRs
 * TEMPLATE — its shipped prompt explicitly says "the operator customizes this prompt to
 * change what happens on each opened PR" (and it ships `readOnly:false`), i.e. it is
 * designed to be rewritten, commonly into a commit-pushing flow, so a type-level exemption
 * would be the wrong default for it. The coordinator types here are complete tasks that finish
 * YOUR in-flight work via a git/gh/API side effect. CAVEAT: the exemption keys on the
 * SCHEDULED TYPE, not the actual per-install prompt, so an operator who rewrites one of
 * these coordinator prompts to make source commits would have that customized run judged by exit
 * code instead of its commit (a telemetry-accuracy tradeoff, not a functional bug). A
 * per-task `noCommitCriterion` contract would remove that caveat but complicates the
 * migration's static type→bucket mapping; deferred as not worth it for the default case.
 *
 * Kept as a leaf so both agentLifecycle (the live criterion) and taskLearning's history
 * backfill (migration-durability) read ONE source of truth. Migration 198 purges the
