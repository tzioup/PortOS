/**
 * PortOS's client for the Codex **app-server** — the JSON-RPC-over-stdio
 * endpoint OpenAI documents for embedding Codex in a product.
 *
 * This is the process half of `lib/codexAccount.js`: it spawns
 * `codex app-server`, speaks the handshake, and exposes exactly the bounded
 * account actions the Providers page needs — read the account, start a ChatGPT
 * sign-in, cancel it, sign out. Nothing else in this phase: no threads, no
 * turns, no inference (that is #5590).
 *
 * Rules this module exists to keep in one place:
 *
 *   - **Codex owns the credentials.** PortOS never reads `~/.codex/auth.json`,
 *     never asks for a token, and never persists one. `account/read` is the
 *     source of truth; every payload crossing this boundary goes through
 *     `redactCodexPayload` before it can reach a log or an error context.
 *   - **Nothing starts at boot.** The child is spawned lazily, on an explicit
 *     request only, so a cold install makes no Codex process and no network
 *     call (AGENTS.md, "No cold-bootstrap LLM calls" — and this is stricter,
 *     since an OAuth flow is not something a boot sequence may begin).
 *   - **Every wait is bounded and settles once.** A request, the handshake, and
 *     a login each carry their own deadline; a child exit fails every pending
 *     request with a typed error rather than hanging the page forever.
 *   - **Writes are serialized.** JSON-RPC framing is newline-delimited, so two
 *     concurrent writers could interleave a frame. Every write is chained onto
 *     one tail promise.
 *
 * The readiness snapshot is CACHED and separately PEEKABLE: `GET /api/providers`
 * decorates cards from `peekCodexAccountReadiness()`, which never spawns
 * anything, while the Providers page's own explicit fetch is what fills that
 * cache.
