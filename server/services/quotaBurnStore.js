/**
 * Quota-burn config + run-log storage (machine-local).
 *
 * Four files under `data/cos/`:
 *   - `quota-burn.json`          — the install's burn plan (see lib/quotaBurnConfig.js)
 *   - `quota-burn-runs.json`     — a capped log of what the runner did, for the page
 *   - `quota-burn-inflight.json` — per-entry render cooldown keys, `key -> epochMs`
 *   - `quota-burn-pending.json`  — reservations for burns whose request has gone
 *     out but has not been accepted yet (see `quotaBurnAcceptance.js`)
 *
 * None of them ships a `data.reference/` seed: an absent file means "nothing
 * recorded", which is exactly right on a fresh install, so there is no migration
 * to run and nothing for `setup-data.js` to overwrite.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT federated, for the same reason the dispatch ledger isn't:
 * quota belongs to a particular machine and provider account. Two peers sharing
 * a burn plan would each think they owned the other's window budget, and the
 * "which managed app" targets differ per machine anyway.
 *
 * Every read normalizes, so a config file written by an older PortOS (or by
 * hand) loads without a migration step — `normalizeQuotaBurnConfig` fills the
 * family set and drops what it can't interpret.
