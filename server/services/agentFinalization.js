 * user-terminated runs, or a run with no task id / workspace / run window to
 * validate against), so downstream telemetry never conflates "not declared" with
 * "declared and failed". For autonomous tasks it verifies the commit on BOTH
 * success and failure — a clean exit that committed nothing is an honest miss,
 * and that is exactly the signal task-learning wants. `committedDuringRun` is
 * non-throwing and hard-timeout-bounded, so a non-repo workspace or a hung git
 * degrades to "no commit" rather than stalling finalize.
 *
 * `startedAt` (epoch ms) bounds the window. A non-finite value means we can't
 * tell this run's commits from anything already in the repo, so the criterion is
 * undeclared (null) rather than a manufactured `false`.
 *
 * `hookResult` is the programmatic-I/O output-hook result (from
 * `dispatchTaskOutputHook`), which finalizeAgent resolves BEFORE calling this so
 * those task types can be judged by their real deliverable; `success` is the
 * runner's exit-code verdict that hook result is weighed against. Both are
 * absent/null for every other task shape.
 *
 * That branch is also the only one that can return `SKIP_LEARNING_VERDICT` — the

 * The question this answers is about the AGENT'S OUTPUT, not about whether the
 * hook's downstream side effect ultimately landed. So a hook that accepted the
 * payload and then couldn't reach the tracker (`file-failed`, `tracker-read-failed`)
 * is NOT a failure of the run: the reasoning was sound and delivered, and a forge
 * outage is environmental. Blaming the run would tank the type's measured success
 * rate — and, through the shared classification below, auto-park the whole task
 * type — every time `gh` has a bad afternoon. Deliberate, not inherited: raised in
 * review on #2727 and kept.
 *
 * Delegates the accept/reject classification to `resolveTypeFailureSignal`, the
 * same pure decision the #2616 type-level failure ledger uses — so the learning
 * verdict and the ledger can never drift apart on what counts as a bad run, and a
 * new benign reason only has to be taught to one function.
 *
 * Sentinel discipline throughout — FOUR distinct answers, never collapsed:
 *   - `false` — the hook ran and REJECTED the output (threw, or `unparseable-response`).
 *   - `null`  — NOTHING evaluated the output (no hook ran, it timed out, or it
 *     returned no structured outcome), so no criterion was declared and
 *     task-learning falls back to the exit code exactly as before. "Not evaluated"
 *     must never become "accepted".
 *   - `true`  — the hook ran and accepted the output.
 *   - `SKIP_LEARNING_VERDICT` — the hook aborted BEFORE it could look at the
 *     output at all (`no-app` / `app-not-found`), so there is nothing to learn
 *     from and the run must not be recorded (#4107). Distinct from `null`,
 *     which still records the run against its exit code.
