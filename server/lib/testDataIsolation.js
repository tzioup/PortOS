/**
 * Runtime backstop: no test may WRITE into the checkout's real `data/` tree.
 *
 * ## Why a runtime guard, not another static rule
 *
 * `testDataIsolation.guards.test.js` is the always-on *static* half of this
 * defense: it text-scans every test file for a path spelling that names the
 * install's `data/` directory. Its own header explains the hole it leaves — a
 * suite that imports the real `PATHS` and reads a data-rooted member
 * (`PATHS.brain`, `PATHS.missions`, …) with no redirect is invisible to a text
 * scan, and ~50 of ~1300 scoped test files legitimately use that spelling, so
 * closing it statically would need a 50-entry allowlist that rots.
 *
 * That spelling was covered *empirically* by the two-run read probe (#3687):
 * plant records in the real tree, re-run, and a test that now fails is leaking.
 * A read leak announces itself as a failing assertion. A WRITE leak does not —
 * persisting fixture bytes over the user's records changes nothing about
 * whether assertions pass, so the more damaging half went undetected. PR #6171
 * is the proof it is not hypothetical: `providerUsage.test.js` persisted its
 * fixture quota cards over the machine's real `data/provider-quotas.json` and
 * then invalidated the `usage` sync checksum, federating the fabricated values
 * to subscribed peers.
 *
 * So the write half is closed at RUNTIME instead, in the shared write
 * primitives. This is the filesystem analogue of the database protection in
 * `lib/db.js` — `isTestRunner()` plus the `query()` backstop that refuses row
 * writes to a non-test database — which exists because a suite once wiped real
 * records. A runtime backstop needs no allowlist: it fires on the write that
 * actually reaches the real root, and stays silent for the ~50 suites that
 * name `PATHS.*` but never get there.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * Inert outside an actual Vitest worker — production writes are never
 * touched, and the `isVitestRunner()` check (narrower than `isTestRunner()`:
 * only `process.env.VITEST`, not `NODE_ENV=test` alone — see its doc comment)
 * comes first everywhere so a non-Vitest call costs one `process.env` read and
 * no syscall. `NODE_ENV=test` alone is not enough here: `scripts/smoke-boot.js`
 * sets it on the real server boot to select the file-backend escape hatch, and
 * that boot's writes into the real `data/` tree are correct, not a leak.
 *
 * Under the runner it fires from the shared primitives in `fileCore.js` /
 * `jsonIo.js` (`atomicWrite`, `ensureDir`'s create path, `writeFileGuarded`,
 * `appendFileGuarded`, `copyFileGuarded`, `rmGuarded`, `unlinkGuarded`,
 * `createWriteStreamGuarded`, `appendJSONLine`) and from
 * `collectionStore`'s record delete. All services mutating files under `data/`
 * route through these guarded wrappers (#6203).
 *
 * A suite that genuinely needs a data root redirects it with
 * `createTempDataRoot()` + `makePathsProxy()` from `lib/mockPathsDataRoot.js`;
 * those roots live under `os.tmpdir()`, so they resolve outside the real root
 * and pass untouched.
 *
 * `server/lib/aiToolkit/` deliberately has NO such guard: that tree is vendored
 * and self-contained and must not import out to other PortOS modules (see
 * `aiToolkit/AGENTS.md`).
