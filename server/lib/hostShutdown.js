/**
 * Host-shutdown signal + durable marker.
 *
 * `portos-server` is restarted routinely — pm2's memory ceiling, a manual
 * `pm2 restart`, a code deploy. pm2's TreeKill signals every descendant of the
 * server, so a CoS TUI agent whose PTY the server owns dies WITH the server
 * even though the durable `portos-cos` runner never went down (issue #3202).
 *
 * That teardown is an INTERRUPTION, not an outcome, and PortOS has to be able to
 * tell the two apart later — after the process that witnessed it is gone. Two
 * signals do that:
 *
 *   1. **In-process flag** (`markHostShuttingDown` / `isHostShuttingDown`) —
 *      read by the TUI spawner's PTY-exit handler so a PTY that vanishes mid
 *      shutdown is never finalized as a completed run. Sync, allocation-free,
 *      and safe to set first thing inside a signal handler.
 *   2. **Durable marker** (`writeHostShutdownMarker`) — a small JSON file naming
 *      the agents that were live when the signal arrived. The next boot's orphan
 *      sweep reads it to classify those agents as *interrupted by a host
 *      restart* rather than as ordinary orphans, so they don't burn orphan-retry
 *      budget or trip the 30-minute orphan cooldown for a fault they didn't
 *      cause.
 *
 * The marker is deliberately tiny and best-effort: it is written inside the
 * graceful-shutdown window (which has a hard 10s ceiling), so every function
 * here is non-throwing and returns a falsy/empty result rather than propagating
 * an I/O failure into shutdown. A missing marker simply degrades recovery to the
 * pre-existing orphan path — the old, safe behavior.
