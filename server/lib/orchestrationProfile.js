/**
 * Orchestration profiles for CoS agent runs (issue #5992).
 *
 * A CoS task normally resolves ONE provider and ONE model for its whole run, so
 * a user who wants strong reasoning for the planning also pays that model's rate
 * for the mechanical editing. An orchestration profile splits the run into three
 * ROLES — architect (plans and writes specs), implementer (executes one spec at
 * a time), reviewer (checks the result) — each with its own provider/model, plus
 * a per-step reasoning rung the architect names in the spec it hands down.
 *
 * This module is the pure vocabulary + normalizer + spec-directive grammar. The
 * Zod surface lives in `cosValidation.js`, model selection in
 * `services/agentModelSelection.js`, and the prompt doctrine in
 * `services/promptSections/orchestrationDoctrine.js` — all of them read the
 * definitions HERE so the four cannot drift.
 *
 * Opt-in by construction: `direct` is the default mode and every accessor
 * returns null for a task that carries no profile, so an install that never
 * configures one behaves exactly as it did before.
