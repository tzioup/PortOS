/**
 * Import-scoping guards (#6009).
 *
 * The Linux CI server suite spends more wall time importing modules than
 * running assertions, and almost none of that is any one test's fault: a
 * handful of widely-reached modules each pulled a subtree they only needed a
 * constant (or a boot-time function) from, and every test file downstream paid
 * for the whole thing. Narrowing those imports cut the suite's static module
 * instantiations — the sum, over all 1,588 server test files, of the modules in
 * each one's import closure — from ~115.5k to ~94.5k (-18%).
 *
 * That is a property nothing else in the tree defends, and it regresses
 * silently: re-pointing one of these imports back at the convenient barrel
 * still passes every behavioral test, it just quietly re-adds thousands of
 * module instantiations to CI. So each narrowing is pinned here as a negative
 * reachability assertion, paired with a positive control (per the contract in
 * `staticImportGraph.js`: a resolver gap must not be able to make the walk look
 * clean).
 *
 * BEFORE narrowing one of these — or any other production import — read the
 * "Import scoping" section of `server/AGENTS.md`. Bypassing a barrel that a
 * suite `vi.mock()`s reaches the real implementation instead of the double, and
 * the failure surfaces in an unrelated test file.

/**
 * The trend metric, as a budget.
 *
 * The rows above are exact: each defends one edge. This defends the property
 * they exist for — that the suite as a whole does not drift back toward
 * importing what it never runs — and it is the only assertion here that catches
 * a NEW heavy edge somewhere nobody has thought to add a row for.
 *
 * It is a budget, not a high-water mark. It sits ~1.5k above the measured total
 * so ordinary growth (a new service plus its suite) does not fail it, while the
 * shape this file exists to catch — one eager edge into a heavy subtree,
 * multiplied by every suite crossing it — moves the number by thousands.
 *
 * If a change pushes past it, first ask whether the new import belongs at module
 * scope at all. If it does, raise the number in the same commit and say what was
 * added. When a narrowing drops the total well below it, lower it — a budget
 * nobody tightens stops measuring anything.
 *
 * History, over the test files under `server/` only — the same denominator
 * #6009 reported, and what `serverTestFiles()` below walks:
 *   115,519 before #6009 · 96,233 after · 83,439 after #6156 · 85,105 after #5992 (orchestration profiles service & routes).
 *
 * Raised to 88,000 in #6305. The budget had drifted to within single digits of
 * the measured total, so the next ordinary addition was always going to trip it
 * — #6305's own share is ~43 (two new suites, plus one leaf service module,
 * `services/codexOssSupport.js`, reached by the 14 suites that cross
 * `services/providerPrerequisites.js`). That is the ordinary growth this budget
 * is documented to tolerate, not the shape it exists to catch, so the fix is to
 * restore the ~1.5k headroom the number is supposed to carry rather than to
 * inch it up by a hundred each time. It stays thousands below what ONE eager
 * edge into a heavy subtree costs, which is what actually has to fail here.

// #6350: Pi's vendor leaf is necessarily reached by the shared dispatcher.
// Deferring catalog/version parsers removes 296 instantiations (88,360 →
// 88,064). Restore the documented ~1.5k allowance for ordinary leaf growth;
// keep the negative runtime-installer guard above so eager parsing cannot return.
//
// #6377 measures 89,889. Its share is ~389, and it is the tolerated shape, not
// the one this budget exists to catch: two new LEAF vocabulary modules with no
// subtree behind them — `lib/taskTargetScope.js` (four constants, zero imports)
// and `lib/quotaBurnTaskRef.js` (pure shape + resolver, importing only
// `objects.js`, which every reacher already had). They are reached by the ~200
// suites that cross `lib/quotaBurnConfig.js`, so a leaf costs ~200 apiece with
// nothing to defer. Restore the ~1.5k allowance again rather than inching the
// number up by a few hundred per PR.
//
// #6368 adds `lib/callerModePolicy.js`, another zero-dependency leaf reached by
// the routing boundary and the lib barrel (~92 instantiations). Same tolerated
// shape; it fits inside the allowance above.
//
// #6375 adds `lib/autonomousJobIntervals.js` — the autonomous-job cadence
// vocabulary `cosValidation.js` validates against, so ~194 suites reach it. It is
// a zero-import leaf (its time units are declared locally precisely so it drags
// nothing); the alternative is re-declaring the cadence list at the Zod boundary,
// which is the drift that issue exists to close. Fits inside the allowance above.
//
// #6364 retires the server/client copy convention, splitting four pure leaves
// out of modules the client now imports (`bibleLimits.js` out of `storyBible.js`,
// `portosUrls.js` out of `ports.js`, `youtubeUrlAssert.js` out of `youtubeUrl.js`,
// `avatarStyles.js` in from the client tree). Each is one extra NODE on a path
// that already existed — a flatter graph, not a new eager edge into a heavy
// subtree. Fits inside the allowance above.
//
// #6380 measures 91,710 — the ~1.5k allowance restored at #6377 is spent, so
// re-measure and restore it rather than inching. The +371 is ONE new suite,
// `services/cosTaskGenerator.auditMode.test.js`, and its cost IS its point: it
// generates a real audit task through `cosTaskGenerator.js` (274) and renders
// the final agent prompt from it through `agentPromptBuilder.js` (+94
// marginal), because the file-issues mode is enforced across exactly that seam
// and neither half alone can prove an issues-only run cannot acquire
// commit/push/PR instructions. No new eager edge into a heavy subtree: the
// production change adds only `lib/auditCatalog.js` (a zero-import leaf) to
// `autonomousJobs/skillTemplates.js`, worth 2.
// #6434: after deferring the private sandbox at all three CoS call sites,
// this branch measures 93,722 versus 93,229 on its current main base. The
// remaining +493 is the shared policy/provenance leaves and two boundary
// suites, not an eager sandbox/runtime subtree. Main already exceeded the
// previous ceiling; restore the documented ~1.5k ordinary-growth allowance.
// The DEFERRED row above prevents the avoidable sandbox edge from returning.
//
// #6442 adds 344 on top of that base (94,066), which fits inside the allowance
// #6434 restored — so the ceiling stays put. All 344 is three NEW suites and
// none of it a new eager edge; the production change adds no import its module
// did not already reach. The largest,
// services/pipeline/editorial/reviewStaleness.test.js (198), earns its reach:
// only the real SOURCE_RESOLVERS table can prove the evolution lens has its own
// fingerprint token, so a lens edit stales a review while a want/need edit does
// not. services/pipeline/arcPlanner/context.test.js (78) and
// lib/editorial/checks/characterArcEvolution.test.js (68) are boundary tests
// over modules those trees already instantiate.
// #6532: same-origin Eidoverse proxy (`eidoverseProxy.js` + route allowlist)
// loaded via the host mount at boot. Measured 95,246 on this branch (+46 over
// the prior ceiling) — ordinary growth for an intentional main-server edge,
// not an eager heavy subtree. Raise the ceiling to keep the ~1.5k allowance.
//
// Replacing five client hand-copies of server constants (the component and page
// mirrors the earlier sweeps left) with imports added two pure leaves the
// browser bundle reads: `lib/characterIntegrityVocabulary.js`
// (split out of `characterIntegrity.js`, which reaches `crypto`) and
// `lib/creativeBriefLimits.js` (the caps both creative validation modules
// enforce). Measured 95,470 (+223 over main's 95,247): `creativeBriefLimits.js`
// +206 (every suite that reaches `creativeCommissionValidation.js` through
// `validation.js`'s flat re-export), `uuid.js` +56 (newly reached through
// `seriesCharacterArc.js`), the vocabulary leaf +24, less the five deleted
// mirror suites — leaves with nothing behind them to defer, the tolerated shape,
// not an eager edge. Restore the ~1.5k allowance.
//
// #6590 is the same shape again: the image-gen capability literals the client
// hand-copied (input-image caps, the prompt rule, the shipped default
// models/effort, the aspect-ratio alphabets) moved out of three
// `services/imageGen/*` modules — unreachable from the browser bundle because
// they import `errorHandler.js` — into one dependency-free leaf,
// `lib/imageGenCapabilities.js`. Measured 96,975 (+108 over main's 96,867): the
// leaf is +1 in each of the 108 closures that already reached `imageGen/modes.js`,
// and it pulls in nothing new (its only import, `generationModes.js`, was
// already in every one of them). A leaf with nothing behind it to defer is the
// tolerated shape. The allowance had drifted to ~30 again, so restore the ~1.5k.
