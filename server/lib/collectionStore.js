/**
 * Collection Store — per-type, per-record JSON storage with explicit
 * `schemaVersion` stamping.
 *
 * Layout on disk:
 *
 *     {dir}/
 *     ├── index.json          // { schemaVersion, type, updatedAt, config: {…} }
 *     ├── <id-1>/
 *     │   └── index.json      // the record itself
 *     └── <id-2>/
 *         └── index.json
 *
 * Replaces the legacy "one big JSON file per type" pattern (where every write
 * rewrites the whole file and every load parses every record) once a
 * collection has outgrown it. See `data/runs/` for the proven prior-art shape
 * this generalizes.
 *
 * The `config` slot — type-level shared state (convention):
 *   The type index's `config` object holds cross-record state that belongs to
 *   the collection as a whole rather than to any single record — the things
 *   that would otherwise need their own sidecar file. The convention is
 *   grounded in the first real consumer (universeBuilder, see migration 034),
 *   which keeps a capped `config.runs[]` history log alongside its per-universe
 *   records. The agreed shape (see the `TypeIndexConfig` typedef below):
 *
 *     config: {
 *       runs?: [],   // append-mostly cross-record history/audit log,
 *                    //   capped by the consumer (universeBuilder caps
 *                    //   at the last 200) — the established slot
 *       …            // consumers MAY add their own keys; document the
 *                    //   shape next to the consumer that owns it
 *     }
 *
 *   `runs` is the only slot with a shipped consumer today. Treat the slot as
 *   open-but-conventional: each key's value should be an object or array so
 *   the shallow-merge semantics below stay predictable.
 *
 *   Merge semantics: `saveTypeIndex({ config })` shallow-merges at the TOP
 *   level of `config` — `{ ...current.config, ...patch.config }`. A patch that
 *   sets `runs` REPLACES the whole `runs` array; it does NOT deep-merge into
 *   it. So a read-modify-write of an array (or nested-object) slot must load
 *   the current value, mutate a copy, and write the full replacement (see
 *   `recordRun` in universeBuilder). The merge is one level deep only.
 *
 *   Write-fence: `config`-slot writes all share ONE file (`index.json`) across
 *   every record in the type, so a read→modify→write cycle on a slot must run
 *   inside `queueTypeIndexWrite(fn)` to avoid clobbering a concurrent edit.
 *   `recordRun` is the canonical example: it loads the index, appends to
 *   `runs`, caps, and writes — all inside the type-index queue. Use
 *   `saveTypeIndex` for a simple patch (it queues internally); reach for
 *   `queueTypeIndexWrite` directly only when the read and the write must be
 *   fenced together. `defaultTypeIndexConfig` seeds the slot on a fresh type
 *   index (and on any read where `config` is missing or not a plain object);
 *   it is NOT re-applied on later writes.
 *
 * Two versioning concerns coexist:
 *   - The TYPE-LEVEL `schemaVersion` (this file): describes the on-disk
 *     storage layout. Bumped by a migration that changes layout (e.g. a split
 *     from a monolithic JSON to per-record dirs).
 *   - The RECORD-LEVEL `schemaVersion` (carried inside each record by some
 *     services, e.g. universeBuilder): describes the shape of one record's
 *     fields. Bumped by in-memory sanitizers when fields move/rename.
 *
 * These are distinct: a per-record sanitizer can mature without ever bumping
 * the type-level version, and a layout change can stamp a new type-level
 * version while record shape stays at v4.
 *
 * Concurrency model:
 *   - `queueRecordWrite(id, fn)` tail-chains per-id, so two concurrent
 *     read-modify-write cycles on the SAME record serialize, but writes to
 *     DIFFERENT records run in parallel. This is the scalability win over
 *     the single-file write queue.
 *   - `queueTypeIndexWrite(fn)` single-tail-chains writes to the type-level
 *     `index.json` so cross-record state (e.g. a shared `runs[]` log) doesn't
 *     race with itself.
 *   - `saveOne(id, record)` already wraps its write in `queueRecordWrite`, so
 *     plain mutations don't need explicit queueing. Wrap a custom RMW cycle
 *     in `queueRecordWrite(id, async () => { ... })` when an external read
 *     spans the load/save boundary, then call `saveOneNow` inside that queue
 *     so the queued function does not wait on itself.
