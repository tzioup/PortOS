/**
 * Non-blocking conflict journal.
 *
 * All cross-install merges are last-write-wins by `updatedAt`. When LWW would
 * OVERWRITE a local record but BOTH sides edited it independently since the
 * last time they were in sync (a true 3-way divergence), the losing local
 * version is archived here BEFORE the overwrite — so convergence is preserved
 * (peers still agree on the LWW winner, sync never wedges) AND no edit is
 * silently lost (the user can review and restore from the Sharing → Conflicts
 * tab).
 *
 * Divergence signal — per-record `syncBaseHash` (the content hash as of the
 * last time this instance and a peer demonstrably held the same content):
 *
 *     conflict := base != null
 *              && hLocal !== base    // local diverged from the common base
 *              && hRemote !== base   // remote also diverged from it
 *              && hLocal !== hRemote  // and they actually differ
 *
 * `base == null` ⇒ treat as a clean update (conservative: we only ever MISS
 * journaling the first divergence after this feature ships for a given record,
 * never wedge and never false-positive on routine sequential updates).
 *
 * The base hash advances to the remote's hash on EVERY accepted overwrite
 * (clean OR conflicting) — without that, the 60s snapshot loop would re-journal
 * the same unresolved divergence every cycle.
 *
 * This store + the base-hash side store are LOCAL-ONLY: they are never enrolled
 * in PEER_SUBSCRIBABLE_KINDS / snapshot categories / sanitizeStateForWire, so
 * they can never cross the wire (no schema-version bump needed).

 * Eviction only marks `_baseDirty` for a key the map actually held, so a prune

 * settle-waits and made the suite flaky), this is deterministic: the flush is

 *
 * Contract note: stamps performed inside the scope must have settled (the
 * in-memory `setSyncBaseHash` awaited) before `fn` returns, or the terminal
 * flush won't see `_baseDirty` for them. Every caller awaits its stamps/evictions.
 *
 * Depth is module-level, not per-async-context, so CONCURRENT batches merge
 * rather than nest. The tombstone GC fans its `pruneTombstoned*` calls out
 * through one `Promise.all`, so their scopes overlap: the last scope to close
 * flushes every eviction they accumulated. An unbatched concurrent flush that
