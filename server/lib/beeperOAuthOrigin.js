/**
 * Which origin the Beeper OAuth `redirect_uri` may be built from (fork issue
 * #1, final live pass).
 *
 * The redirect URI used to be derived from `req.protocol` + `req.headers.host`
 * alone. Under the Vite dev proxy that is wrong in the one way that breaks the
 * flow: the proxy sets `changeOrigin: true` and forwards no `x-forwarded-*`, so
 * the server sees its OWN origin — the HTTPS API on the API port — rather than
 * the UI origin the browser is actually on. Beeper's consent screen then
 * redirects the browser to a host the TLS certificate does not cover (a
 * Tailscale cert covers `<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net` and nothing else), so the
 * user lands on a certificate error even though the exchange completed.
 *
 * The browser knows its own origin, so it sends it. That makes it UNTRUSTED
 * input — whatever ends up in `redirect_uri` is where Beeper sends the
 * authorization code — so it is validated here rather than used as given:
 *
 *   - It has to be a bare `http(s)` origin: scheme, host, optional port, and
 *     nothing else. A value carrying a path, a query, credentials or a
 *     trailing slash is not an origin and is refused rather than trimmed.
 *   - Its HOST has to be one PortOS already answers on: a loopback spelling,
 *     the host this very request arrived on, or a host named by the install's
 *     configured UI/API origins (`PORTOS_UI_URL` / `PORTOS_API_URL`, both
 *     env-overridable in `ports.js`). The PORT is deliberately not pinned:
 *     the UI and the API are different ports of the same install, which is the
 *     whole case this exists for.
 *
 * Anything else is refused and the caller falls back to the request-derived
 * origin — the previous behaviour, so a rejected value never leaves the user
 * worse off than before.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no request object, nothing to mock.
