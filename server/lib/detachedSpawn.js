// Spawn a long-running media-job child that SURVIVES a `pm2 restart
// portos-server`.
//
// pm2's TreeKill walks the parent→child process tree (`ps -e -o pid=,ppid=`)
// and SIGINTs every descendant of portos-server on restart/stop — and
// portos-server restarts routinely (memory ceiling). A multi-hour LoRA trainer
// or video render spawned as a normal child therefore dies mid-run, losing
// hours of GPU work to a process completely unrelated to training.
//
// `detached: true` does NOT help: it puts the child in a new session/process
// group (Node calls setsid), but TreeKill keys on PPID, not the process group,
// so the still-PPID-linked child is found and killed anyway. `treekill: false`
// on the app makes pm2 fail to reap the old node process (lingers on :5555 →
// EADDRINUSE crash-loop). So the fix has to happen spawn-side.
//
// The trick here is a pure-`sh` double-fork so the actual job process reparents
// to init (PPID=1) and leaves pm2's tree entirely, while the server keeps
// streaming its output by tailing on-disk log files:
//
//   server ──spawn(detached)──▶ outer `sh`   (exits within ~1ms)
//                                   │ `{ … } &`  backgrounded subshell
//                                   ▼
//                              supervisor sh   (reparents to init when outer
//                                   │           sh exits — PPID becomes 1)
//                                   ▼
//                                job process    (PPID = supervisor)
//
// Once the outer `sh` exits, TreeKill walking down from portos-server finds
// neither the supervisor nor the job. The supervisor `wait`s on the job and
// records its exit status to a file, so the server can still report success /
// failure for the lifetime it's up. (`setsid(1)` is unavailable on macOS, so
// we rely on Node's `detached` for the new session plus reparent-to-init from
// the double-fork — no external launcher binary needed.)
//
// Windows has no `sh` and no reparent-to-init, so it reaches the same place by
// a different route — a launcher that exits and leaves a supervisor behind (see
// the block above `WINDOWS_SUPERVISOR`). Both arms write the same control dir
// and hand back the same handle, so this module has exactly ONE code path per
// caller; the platforms differ only in how a cancel reaches the job's
// descendants — a process-group signal on POSIX, `taskkill /T /F` on Windows
// (#6170).
//
// The returned object is ChildProcess-LIKE — it exposes `pid`, `stdout`,
// `stderr` (EventEmitters emitting `data`/`end`), `on('close', (code,
// signal))`, `on('error', err)`, `kill(signal)`, `killed`, `exitCode`,
// `signalCode` — so existing spawn call sites adopt it with minimal change.
//
// A restarted server can RE-ATTACH to a survivor via reattachDetached(): the
// control dir's log/pid/exit files outlive the process, so a fresh tailer
// streams the (already-written + still-arriving) output and emits 'close' when
// the supervisor records the exit status — exactly as if the original handle
// had never gone away (#1332).

 * does before anything is dispatched.
 *
 * On Windows the dispatch is `taskkill /T /F`, which terminates the job OUT OF
 * BAND: the supervisor then records whatever ordinary non-zero status Windows
 * left behind, and the tailer would report `close(1, null)` where Node's own
 * `kill()` reported `close(null, 'SIGKILL')`. Callers classify a cancel on
 * exactly that signal — videoGen's watchdog-success check keeps a finished
 * .mp4 only when `signal === 'SIGKILL'`, and `describeSignalDeath` reads it for
 * the failure reason — so remember the signal we ASKED for and let the tailer
 * stamp it. That records the request without waiting to confirm the tree died
 * from it, which is precisely what libuv does for a native kill (it stamps
 * exit_signal at request time). POSIX needs none of this: the supervisor's

// ─── Windows equivalent of the double-fork ───────────────────────────────────
//
// Windows has no `sh` and no reparent-to-init, but pm2 kills an app there with
// `taskkill /pid <app> /T /F`, which walks the SAME parent→child tree the POSIX
// launcher escapes — so a plain child of portos-server dies with it exactly as
// it does on POSIX. The escape is a launcher that exits immediately, leaving
// the supervisor with a dead parent and therefore outside the server's tree:
//
//   server ──spawn──▶ launcher powershell   (exits in ~200ms)
//                          │ Process.Start
//                          ▼
//                     supervisor powershell  (parent already gone, so
//                          │                  `taskkill /T` from the server
//                          ▼                  never reaches it)
//                       job process
//
// The supervisor redirects the job's stdout/stderr into the control dir and
// records its pid and exit status there, so the shared tailer below streams a
// Windows job exactly as it streams a POSIX one.
//
// Reading the job spec from `job.json` (rather than interpolating it into the
// script) keeps paths with spaces, quotes, or `$` out of PowerShell's parser.
// `$null = $p.Handle` caches the process handle BEFORE the wait: without it
// `Start-Process -PassThru` hands back an object whose `ExitCode` reads back
// empty once the process is gone, and the tailer would never see a status.
//
// `-NoNewWindow` (NOT `-WindowStyle Hidden`) is what keeps this off Windows'
// default-terminal handoff: only `-NoNewWindow` sets `CreateNoWindow`, while
// `-WindowStyle Hidden` merely passes SW_HIDE and still allocates a console
// host — condition 3 of docs/WINDOWS_CONSOLE.md. The job inherits the
// supervisor's own (window-less) console, so it still HAS one and a console
// host like powershell runs normally.
//
// The catch must write the `exit` sentinel and must NOT touch stdout/stderr.log:
// `Start-Process`'s redirect holds both under an exclusive lock for as long as
// the job lives, so a throw AFTER a successful launch (a faulting
// `WaitForExit`, a sharing violation on the pid write) would fail on its own
// error write and never reach the sentinel — leaving the tailer polling
// forever, `executeUpdate`'s promise unsettled, and the update lock wedged
// until its 30-minute stale timeout. Before the launch nothing holds the log,
// so a launch failure is reported there where the caller's stderr stream sees
// it; after it, the error goes to a file of its own.

 * spawn: the survivor reparented to init, so we never had (and don't need) a
 * child handle to it; the on-disk logs are the channel.
 *
 * Replaying from offset 0 means the consumer's line handler sees the FULL

 * dead PID with no exit sentinel) — the caller should reap+fail instead. The

 * record, same as the original spawn.
 *
 * PID trust: like reapDetached/cancel, this trusts the persisted PID. In the
 * vanishingly-unlikely case the OS recycled it onto an unrelated live process
 * before boot, isAlive() reports true and we'd tail for an exit that never
 * comes — but the caller (the training queue) wraps the re-attached run in its
 * flat idle watchdog (WATCHDOG_TRAINING_MS), which fails the run and frees the
