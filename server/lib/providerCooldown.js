/**
 * Provider cooldown policy — "this run failed; should the provider be benched,
 * and for how long?"
 *
 * One answer, shared by both paths that can observe a provider failing:
 *   - `promptRunner.js` (a one-shot prompt cascade), and
 *   - `agentFinalization.js` (a finished CoS agent run).
 *
 * They used to disagree: the prompt path had this table, and the agent path
 * benched only usage/rate limits — so an `agy` TUI agent blocked on account
 * verification left the provider marked healthy and the next dequeued task
 * picked it again and died the same way. Keeping the policy here means a
 * category benches for the same duration no matter which path noticed.
 *
 * Pure — no I/O, no provider-status handle. Callers own the actual marking.

// USAGE_LIMIT is absent because `markUsageLimit` parses the wait time
// from the error body (e.g. "resets 5pm"). Values target the timescale
// the user can plausibly recover the underlying cause:
//   RATE_LIMIT      — 5m: provider-side counter typically clears in minutes
//   AUTH_ERROR      — 15m: usually a config issue that needs human action
//   MODEL_NOT_FOUND — 30m: also config; longer because retry is unlikely
//   QUOTA_EXCEEDED  — 60m: billing/credits; retry sooner is futile
//   NETWORK_ERROR   — 2m: usually a transient hiccup
//   RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED — 2m: a local GPU that just OOM'd needs the in-flight
//                     work to drain before it can serve the same context again;
//                     the endpoint itself is healthy, so this is a short bench
//   TIMEOUT/UNKNOWN — 1m: short enough to retry, long enough to skip
//                     while the immediate workload retries via fallback

 * would take its OTHER valid models offline for the full cooldown (e.g. one bad
