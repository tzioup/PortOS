/**
 * Quota-burn step → scheduled-task REFERENCE, plus its per-invocation overrides.
 *
 * A burn step used to BE its work: a copied prompt in a free-form `params` bag
 * keyed by a `jobType` from a quota-only enum, with no durable link back to the
 * scheduled task it was cloned from. Preset identity was never persisted at all
 * — both `quotaBurnPresets.js` and the client's `matchedPreset` re-derived it by
 * comparing prompt text, so editing one word of a shipped prompt orphaned the
 * step. This module replaces that with a reference the step actually stores.
 *
 * Two reference kinds, discriminated on `kind`:
 *   - `builtin` — a PortOS scheduled task TYPE (`ux`, `security`, …), plus the
 *     managed app it targets when the type requires one. Scope rules come from
 *     `taskTargetScope.js`, the same contract the schedule's own request gate
 *     reads.
 *   - `custom`  — an app custom scheduled job, addressed by its id. The job
 *     record owns its app scope, so the reference deliberately stores no
 *     `appId`: a second copy could disagree with the job it points at.
 *
 * Everything the burn wants to do DIFFERENTLY from the task's saved settings
 * lives in `overrides` (provider / model / effort / run params). An unset
 * override inherits; nothing here ever writes back to the schedule.
 *
 * Pure: shape, normalization, and a resolver that takes the catalog as an
 * argument. No storage, no provider I/O, no imports out of `lib/`.
 *
 * `evaluateOnDemandEligibility` below is deliberately WIDER than the burn: it is
 * the one gate ladder for invoking a built-in scheduled task on demand, read
 * both by this module's resolver (so the page can say why a step cannot run) and
 * by `taskSchedule.triggerOnDemandTask` (so dispatch refuses for the same
 * reasons). It lives here because the reason codes and their prose already do,
 * and because a `lib/` module is the only place both a service and a display
 * path can share without one importing the other (#6405).

 * does for a burn family (docs/QUOTA-BURN.md).
 *
 * Pure, and the catalog is an ARGUMENT: the facts about a task type live in the

 * resolves them and hands them in as `entry`.
 *
 *   entry === undefined  the caller has no catalog — every per-type rung goes

 *                        up cannot mass-orphan a user's plan.

 *                        each key `undefined` when that fact is unknown.
 *     `eligible`        — false for a type another automation owns
 *                         (`invocation.userInvokable === false`).

 *                         only by a caller that ENFORCES per-app enablement (see

 * property of the reference itself, so a hand-edited step that dropped its
 * required app is broken whether or not a catalog is to hand.
