/**
 * PortOS schema-version contract for cross-instance sync.
 *
 * Two PortOS instances that exchange data (federated peer push, snapshot
 * sync, share-bucket manifests) need a way to detect a version mismatch
 * BEFORE applying records the receiver can't parse. Without this, an
 * upgraded sender silently corrupts a downstream peer whose code doesn't
 * yet understand a new storage layout.
 *
 * `PORTOS_SCHEMA_VERSIONS` is the per-sync-category WIRE contract — distinct
 * from the storage-layout version stamped on `data/{type}/index.json` (see
 * each service's local `TYPE_SCHEMA_VERSION` const). Bump the wire contract
 * for either:
 *   (a) a storage layout change (e.g. universes 4→5 splitting out of the
 *       monolithic JSON), OR
 *   (b) an additive record-shape change that a not-yet-upgraded peer would
 *       silently strip on round-trip (e.g. pipelineSeries 1→2 for the
 *       `series.arc.readerMap` field).
 * For (a) ship the corresponding `scripts/migrations/NNN-…js` to update the
 * stamped storage version too; for (b) the local storage layout stays put.
 * The number flows through every outbound payload's `portosMeta.schemaVersions`;
 * receivers compare incoming vs local and reject ahead-mismatches (sender too
 * new) or behind-mismatches (sender too old to satisfy a forward-only field).
 *
 * Absent categories default to 0 — the comparator treats 0 as "no check"
 * so historical / un-versioned data categories pass through unchanged.
 * Future PRs that introduce a layout change for `series`, `issues`, etc.
 * add an entry here.

  // v7 = canon objects gained `attachments[]` (structured object↔character

  //
  // NOTE — `catalog` is intentionally NOT bumped for this field (matches the
  // #1287 relationshipLinks precedent). A bible object promoted to the catalog
  // carries `attachments` in `catalog_ingredients.payload`; an older peer's
  // `updateIngredient` → `sanitizeObject` would drop it on a local edit and a
  // catalog sync back could clobber the newer copy. We accept that graceful
  // degradation rather than gate `catalog` — bumping it would pause ALL catalog
  // sync with version-mismatched peers for one additive field, the heavier
  // tradeoff this project has chosen against for additive bible fields. The
  // `universes` gate above already protects the canonical (embedded) copy.
  // v8 adds shared styleReferences[]. Older peers must not sanitize the field
  // away and LWW-sync that loss back to a newer install.
  // v9 = `moodBoardId` added (#4188) — the universe's linked mood board. The
  // pointer rides the wire (mood boards federate, so the id resolves on peers);
  // same rationale as v6/v7/v8: additive + gracefully degrading, but an older

  // `sanitizeTemplate` would silently strip the link and LWW the loss back.
  // v10 = character `voiceCanon` and `identityPack` added (#5378). These are
  // portable, federated production-canon fields; a ≤v9 peer would sanitize
  // them away and LWW the loss back after an unrelated Universe edit.
  universes: 10,

  // that receives and re-sanitizes the record would silently strip the new

  // older sanitizer's omission LWW-strip or overwrite it.
  pipelineIssues: 3,
  // v2 = `series.arc.readerMap` added (Unified Story Builder). Additive +
  // gracefully-degrading, but version-gated so a not-yet-upgraded peer can't
  // round-trip a series through its readerMap-unaware sanitizer and LWW-strip
  // the field back onto a newer peer. Per-category gate → only series sync

  // v3 = `series.arc.tickingClock` added (#1289). Same situation as readerMap:

  // would silently strip the countdown and last-writer-wins the loss back onto
  // the newer peer. Bump makes the older peer reject the ahead-version series
  // transfer instead. Per-category gate → only series sync pauses with old peers.
  // v4 = `series.styleGuide` added (#1303) — a top-level series house-style
  // field (tense/POV/audience/rating/reading-level/tone/conventions). Same
  // silent-strip-then-LWW corruption as readerMap/tickingClock, just one level
  // up: a ≤v3 peer re-sanitizes a series through its styleGuide-unaware
  // `sanitizeSeries`, drops the guide, and last-writer-wins the loss back onto
  // the newer peer. Bump makes the older peer reject the ahead-version series

  // v5 = `series.coverImage` added — a top-level derived field holding the
  // filename of a rendered volume/issue cover, shown as a thumbnail on the
  // pipeline series list. Derived (any peer can recompute it from its own
  // seasons/issues), but it's only recomputed on cover-render or the one-time

  // series through its coverImage-unaware `sanitizeSeries` would drop the

  // v7 = `series.factCritical` + `series.factReference` added (#1588) — the

  // `research.fact-accuracy` editorial check reconciles the prose against. Same
  // silent-strip-then-LWW corruption as styleGuide/characterArcs: a ≤v6 peer

  // would drop the reference (and reset the flag) and last-writer-wins the loss
  // back onto the newer peer. Bump makes the older peer reject the ahead-version
  // series transfer instead. Per-category gate → only series sync pauses with old peers.
  // v8 = `series.editorialCheckConfig` added (#1591) — a per-series map of
  // editorial-check config overrides ({ [checkId]: { [key]: value } }) that tune a
  // check's thresholds (e.g. comic lettering density) for one series without
  // touching the global catalog. Same silent-strip-then-LWW corruption as

  // v9 = `series.severityWeights` + `series.blockingSeverities` added (#1616) —
  // per-series overrides of the editorial health-score severity weights (default
  // high:12/medium:5/low:1) and of which severities count as blocking for each
  // autopilot gate (arc/beatContinuity/editorial). Both default to `{}` (no
  // override → frozen defaults apply). Same silent-strip-then-LWW corruption as
  // editorialCheckConfig: a ≤v8 peer that re-sanitizes a series through its
  // severityWeights/blockingSeverities-unaware `sanitizeSeries` would drop the
  // overrides and last-writer-wins the loss back onto the newer peer. Bump makes
  // the older peer reject the ahead-version series transfer instead. Per-category
  // gate → only series sync pauses with old peers.
  // v10 = `series.arc.foreshadowing` added (#2172) — the arc-overview-emitted
  // plant → reinforce → payoff ledger the Chekhov check consumes. Same additive
  // field INSIDE the series.arc payload as readerMap (v2) / tickingClock (v3): a
  // ≤v9 peer that re-sanitizes a series through its foreshadowing-unaware
  // `sanitizeArc` would silently strip the ledger and last-writer-wins the loss
  // back onto the newer peer. Bump makes the older peer reject the ahead-version
  // series transfer instead. Per-category gate → only series sync pauses with old peers.
  // v11 = `series.styleGuide.voiceExemplars` + `series.styleGuide.voiceAntiExemplars`
  // added (#2179) — the voice exemplar / anti-exemplar "tuning fork" passages. Same
  // additive field INSIDE the federated `styleGuide` sub-object as styleGuide itself
  // (v4): a ≤v10 peer that re-sanitizes a series through its voiceExemplars-unaware
  // `sanitizeStyleGuide` would silently strip the passages and last-writer-wins the
  // loss back onto the newer peer (`preserveAbsentAdditiveFields` only restores a
  // wholly-absent `styleGuide`, not a present-but-sub-field-stripped one). Bump makes
  // the older peer reject the ahead-version series transfer instead. Per-category gate
  // → only series sync pauses with old peers.
  // v12 = `series.exportSettings` added (#2181) — the per-series prose-export
  // config (trim size, interior font, title-page fields) for the compiled-
  // manuscript / ePub / print-interior-PDF exports. Top-level additive field
  // like styleGuide (v4): a ≤v11 peer that re-sanitizes a series through its
  // exportSettings-unaware `sanitizeSeries` would silently strip it and
  // last-writer-wins the loss back onto the newer peer
  // (`preserveAbsentAdditiveFields` restores a wholly-absent `exportSettings`
  // from a BEHIND-version SAME-schema peer, but a wire-received record from an
  // OLDER peer must be rejected outright). Bump makes the older peer reject the
  // ahead-version series transfer instead. Per-category gate → only series sync
  // pauses with old peers.
  pipelineSeries: 12,
  // NOT bumped for the manuscript-review sibling doc now bundled on series
  // pushes/exports (`data/pipeline-series/{id}/manuscript-review.json`).
  // Unlike `readerMap` (v2), the review is NOT a field inside the series
  // record — it's a separate doc that rides a dedicated `manuscriptReview`
  // payload key, so an older peer never round-trips it through the series
  // sanitizer (no silent-strip-then-LWW-back corruption — the readerMap gate's
  // whole reason to exist). It is additive + gracefully degrading: a pre-feature
  // receiver ignores the unknown key (review just doesn't reach it) and ships
  // no review back, so the newer peer's `if (manuscriptReview)` receive guard
  // is a no-op and the local review is preserved. Bumping `pipelineSeries` here
  // would be actively harmful — it would 409-reject the ENTIRE series push
  // (record + issues) to every not-yet-upgraded peer over an OPTIONAL doc that
  // degrades fine. Registering a brand-new gated category would hit the same
  // whole-payload footgun documented for `videoHistory` below. So manuscript-
  // review is intentionally UNGATED today (all peers ship review-doc shape v1).
  // The FIRST incompatible review-doc shape change (manuscriptReview.js
  // SCHEMA_VERSION 1→2, where an older peer's sanitizer would strip a field and
  // LWW it back) MUST introduce a gate then — mirroring the catalog
  // payloadSchemaVersion lockstep note below.
  // ALSO not bumped for the reverse-outline sibling doc (#1348), bundled on
  // series pushes/exports as `data/pipeline-series/{id}/reverse-outline.json`
  // via a dedicated `reverseOutline` payload key. Identical reasoning to the
  // manuscript-review note above: it's a separate doc (not a series field), so
  // an older peer never round-trips it through `sanitizeSeries`; it's additive +
  // gracefully degrading (a pre-#1348 receiver ignores the unknown key and ships
  // none back, so the newer peer's `if (reverseOutline)` receive guard is a
  // no-op and the local outline is preserved); and the sender's legacy-strip
  // retry drops the key so the record/issues still land. Whole-doc LWW on
  // `generatedAt` means there's no per-field strip-then-LWW-back corruption to
  // gate against. The FIRST incompatible outline-doc shape change (reverseOutline.js
  // SCHEMA_VERSION 1→2) MUST introduce a gate then, same as the review above.
  mediaCollections: 1,
  // v1 = author personas (PostgreSQL `authors` table) federated via the
  // per-record peer-sync push pipeline (record kind `author`, sync category
  // `authors`). A brand-NEW synced record type like `storyBuilder` below, so it
  // gets its own per-category gate: a v1 sender pushing to a ≤v0 (pre-feature)
  // receiver is sender-ahead on `authors` and gets a 409 (the older peer's
  // `sanitizeAuthor` would silently strip any future field and LWW it back) —
  // only the authors category pauses; every other category keeps flowing
  // (per-category gate via scopeVersionDiff). A v1 receiver still accepts a ≤v0
  // sender (sender-behind): pre-feature peers never push an `author` record at
  // all, so there's nothing to gate. The FIRST incompatible author-shape change
  // MUST bump this to 2 then (where a v1 peer would round-trip the new shape
  // through an unaware sanitizer).
  authors: 1,
  // v1 = music artists/albums/tracks (PostgreSQL `artists`, `albums`, and
  // `tracks` tables) federated via the per-record peer-sync push pipeline.
  // Each kind gets its own category gate so an older peer can reject only the
  // music record type it cannot parse while unrelated categories keep flowing.
  artists: 1,
  albums: 1,
  // tracks v2 = `track.renders[]` render-history added (every generated/uploaded
  // take, so the studio shows each render as a card + can re-select an earlier
  // one). Additive + gracefully degrading, but version-gated for the same reason
  // as the universes relationshipLinks/attachments fields: a ≤v1 peer that
  // receives and re-sanitizes a track through its renders-unaware `sanitizeTrack`
  // would silently strip the history (keeping only the active pointer) and
  // last-writer-wins the loss back onto the newer peer. Bumping makes the older
  // peer reject the ahead-version track transfer instead. Per-category gate →
  // only track sync pauses with old peers; artists/albums keep flowing. The
  // backfill itself needs no migration — `sanitizeTrack` synthesizes a render
  // from the legacy active pointer on read (see services/tracks/logic.js).
  // tracks v3 = `track.chiptuneScore`/`chiptunePrompt` (#2911, the LLM-composed
  // looping 8-bit score). Version-gated for the identical strip-and-push-back
  // reason as v2: a ≤v2 peer re-sanitizing through its chiptune-unaware
  // `sanitizeTrack` would silently drop the score and LWW the loss back onto
  // the composing peer. (As of #2912 the fields DO participate in the
  // conflict-journal content hash, version-gated so it doesn't retroactively
  // invalidate a base hash stamped before they existed — see
  // lib/conflictJournal.js HASH_FIELDS, whose own version number for this
  // field was chosen to match this one for a human reading both files; the
  // two mechanisms are otherwise independent — HASH_FIELDS gates a purely
  // local hash-store concern, not cross-peer wire compatibility.)
  // tracks v4 = `track.concept` for resumable stepped music-designer drafts.
  // Older peers must reject the record rather than round-trip it through a
  // concept-unaware sanitizer and silently erase the saved creative brief.
  // tracks v5 = render-history entries gained `authoredPrompt` and the explicit
  // nullable `instrumentalOnly` decision. A <=v4 peer would strip both, then LWW
  // the ambiguous render back and make a later remix silently change vocal mode.
  // tracks v6 = render history entries preserve the effective generation
  // executionProfile. Older peers would strip the measured placement on sync.
  tracks: 6,
  // v1 = creative ingredients catalog (Postgres tables: catalog_scraps,
  // catalog_ingredients, catalog_ingredient_sources, catalog_ingredient_refs).
  // v2 = `catalog_ingredients.search_tsv` expanded to also index the
  // character canon fields (physicalDescription, personality) and the
  // type-specific role/motivations/significance fields, so bible-promoted
  // characters become searchable on their main narrative text. The schema
  // is a DROP+re-ADD of the STORED generated column (Postgres can't ALTER
  // its expression); applied in lockstep by `ensureSchema`.
  // v3 = `catalog_ingredient_refs` gained `deleted`/`deleted_at` soft-delete
  // tombstones + an UPDATE trigger that bumps sync_sequence on delete/revive.
  // Older peers (≤v2) hard-DELETE on unlink and never tombstone, so the
  // version gate prevents a v3 receiver from accepting an older sender's
  // payload that would silently miss tombstones.
  //
  // Per-category gate so a new peer can sync its catalog independently of
  // whether other categories are version-locked. Older peers are
  // sender-behind on `catalog` (not ahead), so the receiver still accepts
  // their pushes; newer peers pushing to older receivers are sender-ahead
  // and get 409. `cat-ingredient` and `cat-scrap` record kinds map back
  // here via RECORD_KIND_SCHEMA_CATEGORIES.
  //
  // NOT bumped for the per-record `payload.schemaVersion` stamp added by
  // catalog-payload-schemaversion: that key is additive JSONB that both old
  // and new peers store verbatim (`upsertIngredientFromPeer` writes payload
  // as-is — no sanitizer strips it), and all types are payload-v1 today so no
  // shape actually changed on the wire. The FIRST type that bumps its
  // registry `payloadSchemaVersion` to 2 with a genuine shape change (a peer
  // ≤ that version would round-trip the new shape through an unaware
  // sanitizer) MUST bump `catalog` here in lockstep.
  //
  // v4 = `catalog_ingredient_relations` table (ingredient↔ingredient edges)
  // + a new `relations: [...]` block in the catalog sync envelope. An older
  // (≤v3) receiver doesn't understand the relations block, so a v4 sender
  // pushing to it is sender-ahead on `catalog` and gets a 409 — correct,
  // since the older peer would silently drop every relation edge. v4 receivers
  // still accept ≤v3 senders (sender-behind): those envelopes simply carry no
  // `relations` block and the receiver applies the other four kinds as before.
  // v5 = `catalog_tags` first-class table (id, label, description?, color?,
  // parent_id?, created_at, sync_sequence) + a new `tags: [...]` block in the
  // catalog sync envelope. Same gating rationale as v4: a ≤v4 receiver doesn't
  // understand the `tags` block, so a v5 sender pushing to it is sender-ahead
  // and gets a 409 (otherwise the older peer would silently drop every canonical
  // tag row + its parent hierarchy). The freeform `catalog_ingredients.tags
  // TEXT[]` column is unchanged — canonical tag rows are an additive index, so
  // a v5 receiver still accepts ≤v4 ingredient/scrap/ref/relation pushes; those
  // envelopes simply carry no `tags` block.
  // v6 = `catalog_ingredient_media` join table (typed image/audio/video/doc
  // attachments) + a new `media: [...]` block in the catalog sync envelope.
  // Each media row ships a `media_key` REFERENCE into the receiver's own media
  // library (data/images + history.jsonl sidecar) — never the bytes. Same
  // gating rationale as v4/v5: a ≤v5 receiver doesn't understand the `media`
  // block, so a v6 sender pushing to it is sender-ahead on `catalog` and gets
  // a 409 (otherwise the older peer would silently drop every attachment). A v6
  // receiver still accepts ≤v5 senders (sender-behind); those envelopes carry
  // no `media` block. Media keys that don't resolve against the receiver's own
  // library surface via the metadata-missing integrity endpoint rather than
  // failing the apply.
  // v7 = `catalog_scraps` gained `chunk_index` + `parent_scrap_id` (a long paste
  // chunks into a parent + N child rows; the extractor unions per-child drafts).
  // Both fields ride the scrap sync envelope. Same gating rationale as v4–v6: a
  // ≤v6 receiver doesn't understand child scrap rows, so a v7 sender pushing to
  // it is sender-ahead and gets a 409. A v7 receiver still accepts ≤v6 senders
  // (their scraps carry no chunk fields → chunkIndex 0 / parentScrapId null).
  // v8 = user-defined ingredient types. The definitions are persisted in the
  // catalogUserTypes store (`catalog_user_types` as of #1001; settings.json
  // `catalogUserTypes` before that — the move did NOT bump this version because
  // the wire shape is storage-independent), merge into the active type registry
  // at boot/runtime, and ride a new additive `catalogTypes: [...]` block in the
  // catalog sync envelope (LWW-merged into the receiver's own user-type store).
  // Same gating rationale as v4–v7: a ≤v7 receiver doesn't understand the
  // `catalogTypes` block, so a v8 sender pushing to it is sender-ahead and gets
  // a 409 (otherwise the older peer would silently drop every user-type
  // definition, then reject every ingredient row carrying one of those unknown
  // types). A v8 receiver still accepts ≤v7 senders (sender-behind); their
  // envelopes carry no `catalogTypes` block and the receiver applies the other
  // kinds as before.
  catalog: 8,
  // v1 = cross-machine resumable Story Builder sessions (#730). Sessions are
  // local-only by default and excluded from sync; only `sync: true` sessions

  // nothing to gate. The FIRST incompatible session-shape change MUST bump this

  // unaware sanitizer).
  storyBuilder: 1,
  // v1 = FableLoom stories federate through the per-record push pipeline
  // (record kind/category `fableLoom`). A pre-feature receiver has no merge
  // path for the whole-record story graph, so only this category pauses until
  // both peers upgrade; unrelated categories continue syncing.
  // v2 = scene nodes gained portable `visualCanon` bindings plus the latest
  // render's path-free `visualConditioning` provenance. A v1 peer would strip
  // both during whole-record LWW, so newer sends must pause until it upgrades.
  // v3 = typed playback assets retain one visual-conditioning manifest per

  // A v2 peer would strip that map during whole-record LWW.
  // v4 = the loom pins one canonical protagonist and wardrobe, while each
  // scene records whether that protagonist is on-screen or speaking through a
  // side-device off-screen. A v3 peer would silently strip those fields on a
  // whole-record round trip and could restore wardrobe drift or put a removed
  // protagonist back into a scene.
  // v5 = one loom-level render format pins the aspect ratio and concrete
  // dimensions shared by storyboard stills and motion clips; plot points and
  // scenes gained durable playable-challenge kinds/phase mappings; and durable
  // editorial/final-delivery sign-offs let the ordered workflow survive a
  // reload. A v4 peer would strip those choices and silently reopen completed
  // gates, erase challenge-to-scene mapping, or reintroduce mixed geometry.
  // v6 = the loom-level render pin gained image/video backend, model, and
  // effort preferences. A v5 peer would preserve the format but strip these
  // additive preferences during an unrelated whole-record update.
  fableLoom: 6,
  // v1 = Creative Director projects (PostgreSQL `creative_director_projects`)
  // federated via the per-record peer-sync push pipeline (record kind
  // `creativeDirectorProject`, sync category `creativeDirectorProjects`, #1564).
  // A brand-NEW synced record type like `authors`/`storyBuilder`, so it gets its
  // own per-category gate: a v1 sender pushing to a ≤v0 (pre-feature) receiver is
  // sender-ahead on `creativeDirectorProjects` and gets a 409 — only that
  // category pauses; every other keeps flowing (per-category gate via
  // scopeVersionDiff). A v1 receiver still accepts a ≤v0 sender (sender-behind):
  // pre-feature peers never push a `creativeDirectorProject` at all, so there's
  // nothing to gate. The FIRST incompatible project-shape change MUST bump this
  // to 2 then (where a v1 peer would round-trip the new shape through an unaware
  // sanitizer). The project body is LWW-overwritten whole; scene video renders
  // ride the project's linked media collection (federated separately).
  // v2 = `directive` + `plan` added (CDO Phase 2, #2184) — the production-plan
  // layer (a directive brief + a validated `plan.steps[]` the generalized advance
  // loop executes through the gated tool registry). Additive: a legacy video
  // project leaves both null and behaves exactly as before. Version-gated for the
  // same reason as every prior additive field — the project body is
  // LWW-overwritten WHOLE (`mergeProjectRecord`), so a ≤v1 peer that receives a
  // plan-driven project, re-sanitizes it through its directive/plan-unaware
  // path, and pushes back would silently strip both fields and last-writer-wins
  // the loss onto the newer peer. Bumping makes the older peer reject the
  // ahead-version project transfer instead. Per-category gate → only CD-project
  // sync pauses with old peers; every other category keeps flowing. No record
  // rewrite is needed — existing legacy projects simply lack both keys and the
  // advance loop treats an absent key identically to null (falsy → legacy video
  // flow); migration 175 only seeds the new `cd-plan` prompt stage.
  // v3 = cross-step result references (`{{steps.<stepId>.result.<key>}}` inside
  // `plan.steps[].args`, #2773). Unlike v2 this is NOT about a sanitizer
  // round-trip strip (the refs are free-form `args` strings a v2 sanitizer
  // preserves verbatim) — it's an EXECUTION-semantics break: only the v3 advance
  // loop resolves the syntax. A v2 peer that receives a running reference-plan and
  // then boot-recovers it (`recoverInFlightProjects` resets the step to pending)
  // would dispatch the literal `{{…}}` as e.g. a seriesId, fail/re-plan, and

  // Unlike the immutable, append-only `cosHistory` archives (pure byte

  // v2 = the `challenged` task status + its challenge case/resolution metadata
  // (#2441). A ≤v1 receiver's `TASK_STATUSES` enum lacks `challenged`, so its
  // wire validation would REJECT the whole payload (peerCosTasksSchema.safeParse
  // fails → the sweep skips, never mis-merges). Bumping makes the receiver's
  // GENTLE schema-ahead skip fire FIRST with a clear "schema v2 > local v1"
  // log, instead of a confusing blanket "failed validation" skip. The challenge
  // record itself (`challenge`/`challengeResolution`/`challengeCount`) rides the
  // permissive `metadata` map and round-trips the markdown store like any other
  // metadata, so no new top-level wire field is added — only the status vocab
  // widened. Per-category gate → only cos-tasks sync pauses with old peers.
  // v3 = the PR-follow-up disposition markers `reviewLoopMergeOnly` /
  // `reviewLoopLeaveOpen`. This is an EXECUTION-semantics break, not a shape
  // change: both ride the permissive `metadata` map, so a ≤v2 receiver validates
  // and stores the task fine — and then MIS-RUNS it. Its prompt builder doesn't
  // know either marker, so it re-defaults the deliberately-empty reviewer list
  // back to `[copilot]` and runs a review the task explicitly disabled; on a
  // GitLab MR (the copilot-only fallback) it emits GitHub-only commands that
  // cannot land the MR, orphaning it; and on a JIRA hand-off it merges a PR that
  // must stay open. A claimed-and-mis-run task then LWW-pushes its damaged state
  // back onto the v3 peer, which is exactly the bump trigger (see the
  // `creativeDirectorProjects` 2→3 precedent). Per-category gate → only cos-tasks
  // sync pauses until the peer upgrades.
  // v4 = the `workTracker` dispatch marker (repo-study / tracker-filing tasks) and
  // the `reviewerEfforts` per-reviewer effort pins. Same EXECUTION-semantics break
  // as v3, for the same reason: both ride the permissive `metadata` map, so a ≤v3
  // receiver validates and stores the task fine — and then MIS-RUNS it.
  // `taskTypeHooks.isTrackerFilingDispatch` reads `metadata.workTracker` to decide
  // that a run which filed issues and left the tree clean SATISFIED its criterion;
  // a ≤v3 peer only knows the `TRACKER_FILING_TASK_TYPES` set, so it grades that
  // same run a validation miss, finalizes it failed, poisons the provider/model
  // learning bucket, and LWW-pushes the damaged state back onto the v4 peer.
  // `reviewerEfforts` is the milder instance: a ≤v3 peer runs the review at the
  // reviewer CLI's default effort instead of the pinned tier, silently downgrading
  // a review the user deliberately strengthened. Per-category gate → only cos-tasks
  // sync pauses until the peer upgrades.
  // v5 = the `metadata.prompt` / `metadata.context` split (#4153): the full
  // agent-facing payload now rides `prompt` and `context` reverts to the
  // one-line human note. Same EXECUTION-semantics break as v3/v4 — `prompt`
  // rides the permissive `metadata` map, so a ≤v4 receiver validates and stores
  // the task fine and then MIS-RUNS it: its prompt builder only knows
  // `metadata.context`, so the agent is handed a one-line description with the
  // entire Phase 1–7 body (or `/do:*` claim prompt) missing, does the wrong
  // work, and LWW-pushes that damaged state back onto the v5 peer. Readers on
  // v5 fall back to `metadata.context`, so the reverse direction degrades
  // gracefully — the gate exists for the forward one. Per-category gate → only
  // cos-tasks sync pauses until the peer upgrades.
  // v6 = `metadata.targetInstanceId`, the per-task pin to ONE federated instance
  // (#4520). Same EXECUTION-semantics break as v3/v4/v5 — the pin rides the
  // permissive `metadata` map, so a ≤v5 receiver validates and stores the task
  // fine and then RUNS IT ANYWAY: its spawn guards only know the opportunistic
  // claim/lease, so the laptop happily claims the task the user pinned to the
  // GPU box, executes it with the wrong hardware/tooling, and LWW-pushes that
  // run's state back onto the v6 peer — which by then had correctly passed over
  // the task. Per-category gate → only cos-tasks sync pauses until the peer
  // upgrades.
  // v7 = plan-only issue-filing tasks (metadata.planOnly, the forced
  // plan-task --yes invocation, and the task-description context
  // bridge). A <=v6 peer accepts the permissive metadata map but does not
  // understand the no-delivery execution contract, so it can claim the task
  // and run the workflow without the description context needed to file the
  // issue. Per-category gate -> only cos-tasks sync pauses until the peer
  // upgrades.
  cosTasks: 7,
  // NOTE: `videoHistory` is intentionally NOT listed here. The version gate
  // rejects the ENTIRE snapshot/push payload on ANY ahead-mismatch (the
  // comparator walks the union of keys), so declaring a brand-new key would
  // make every not-yet-upgraded peer reject ALL categories (universe,
  // pipeline, …) — severing sync across a federation that upgrades on
  // independent schedules. videoHistory is a flat append-only array merged by
  // id with LWW-on-createdAt; the merge already tolerates unknown/extra rows,
  // so it does not need whole-payload gating. An older peer that lacks the
  // `videoHistory` route simply rejects that one category request and keeps
  // syncing everything else.
  //
  // The gate is now PER-CATEGORY (see `scopeVersionDiff` below + its three
  // call sites: dataSync `applyRemote`, peerSync push, sharing importer), so
  // adding a new key here or bumping one category only gates transfers of
  // THAT category — unrelated categories keep flowing. videoHistory stays
  // unlisted because it has no versioned storage layout at all, not because
  // of the old whole-payload footgun.
