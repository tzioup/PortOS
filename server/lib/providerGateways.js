/**
 * `PROVIDER_GATEWAYS` — one row per hosted OpenAI-compatible gateway an OpenCode
 * CLI/TUI wrapper can front-end (OrcaRouter, OpenRouter).
 *
 * Before this file, OrcaRouter wasn't *a* gateway — it was *the* gateway: the
 * boolean `orcarouterBacked` and the literal id `'orcarouter'` were hand-copied
 * across ~15 server and client files (namespace resolution, the OpenCode config
 * builder, both zod schemas, the model-fetcher table, the sibling-key attach,
 * the prerequisite check, and the two "this is NOT a local runtime" carve-outs).
 * Adding a second gateway that way would have doubled a copy-paste axis — the
 * same pressure `providerVendors.js` was created to relieve (#3618). Every
 * dispatch site now asks this registry instead.
 *
 * A gateway is distinct from a *local runtime* (`ollamaBacked`, `vllmBacked`,
 * `sglangBacked`, …) in three ways every consumer keys on:
 *   - it is REMOTE, so there is no daemon to probe (`localRuntimeKind` and
 *     `isLocalBackedClaude` both exclude it);
 *   - it always AUTHENTICATES, and the wrapper deliberately stores no key — the
 *     sibling API record with the same id as the gateway owns it;
 *   - its upstream models own their own reasoning switch, so it exposes no
 *     thinking toggle (`THINKING_STYLE[<gateway>] === null`).
 *
 * Dependency-light on purpose (mirrors `providerVendors.js` / `cliProviderArgs.js`):
 * it imports nothing, so it stays importable from `providerModels.js`, which the
 * standalone autofixer process pulls in.
 *
 * **Three copies of this table exist, by architecture, and must stay in lockstep:**
 *   1. this file — the PortOS server;
 *   2. `aiToolkit/internal/gateways.js` — the vendored toolkit, which may not
 *      import out of its own directory (see `aiToolkit/AGENTS.md`);
 *      `providerGateways.parity.test.js` fails when the two drift;
 *   3. `client/src/utils/providers.js` — the browser, which cannot import server
 *      code at all; `providerGateways.parity.test.js` reads it as TEXT (never
 *      imports it) and pins the fields it carries.
 */

/**
 * @typedef {object} ProviderGateway
 * @property {string} id — the OpenCode provider namespace, the `gatewayBacked`
 *   marker value, AND the id of the sibling `api` record holding the key. One
 *   string for all three on purpose: the sibling lookup is `providers[gateway.id]`.
 * @property {string} label — human name for UI copy and prerequisite labels.
 * @property {string} baseURL — the OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
 * @property {string} apiKeyEnv — the env var the spawner exports for OpenCode.
 * @property {string} [legacyMarker] — the pre-registry per-gateway boolean field
 *   (`orcarouterBacked`). Records written before `gatewayBacked` existed still
 *   carry it, and installs upgrade on their own schedule, so this is read
 *   FOREVER — no migration rewrites stored records.
 * @property {string} [legacyApiKeyField] — a pre-registry alias for the wrapper's
 *   own key field.
