 *
 * `providerGraphPreview.js` (#6366) answers "what WOULD an import create?" from
 * provider records alone. This module owns the records that survive a restart:
 * how a preview becomes durable rows, how those rows are sanitized for a
 * client, how they are materialized back into `data/providers.json`, and — the
 * load-bearing part — how a persisted graph is RECONCILED against a provider
 * file that may have moved underneath it.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. No database handle, no file I/O, no clock beyond the
 * injected id minter, so the reconciliation contract (which is where the data
 * loss lives) is testable without a Postgres or a temp directory.
 *
 * The three states a route's connection-owned values can be in:
 *
 *   - `projected` — last snapshot ACKNOWLEDGED as present in providers.json.
 *   - `pending`   — committed to the DB, not yet acknowledged as written.
 *   - the file's ACTUAL values, read fresh at reconcile time.
 *
 * Keeping both snapshots is what makes a crash between the DB commit and the
 * file write recoverable, and what stops a retry from clobbering a third value
 * some other writer put there — see {@link planGraphReconciliation}.

 * {@link identityKey} equality here would therefore match none of a
 * multi-transport row's own routes and clone every binding off it, silently
 * undoing the explicit link the connection graph exists to hold.
 *
 * Containment, precisely:
 *
 *   - `kind` matches exactly — a route never migrates between backend kinds.
 *   - The route's transport protocol is DECLARED by the connection at the same
 *     `baseUrl`. A route declaring no transport at all matches only a
 *     connection that declares none either: "names no endpoint" must never
 *     collapse into "sits on whichever backend you like".
 *   - The route's credentials are a SUBSET of the connection's, with every
 *     shared key equal. A row carrying one key per protocol is normal (Claude
 *     sends a token where OpenCode sends none); disagreeing on a key they share
 *     is a real move, and still detaches.
 *
 * `sameConnectionIdentity` stays strict on purpose: it answers "are these two
 * records the same backend?" at IMPORT time, where equality is what stops an
 * accidental merge. This is the looser question reconciliation asks about a
 * link a human already made — and the same question `createBinding` asks of a
 * freshly minted record, so a create is accepted on exactly the terms the next

 *     crash may have landed a DB commit without its file write;
 *   - **after a legacy write** — an old client's `PATCH /api/providers/:id`
 *     changed a connection-owned field with no idea a graph exists;
 *   - **after a restore** — half a backup can arrive without the other half.
 *
 * The rules, in the order they are applied per route:
 *
 *   1. The record is GONE → drop its row. A deleted provider is never
 *      resurrected; any saved selection naming it stays a visibly unresolved
 *      pin, and an emptied binding/connection is kept for explicit cleanup
 *      rather than deleted or auto-refilled.
 *   2. A `pending` snapshot exists and the file matches it → the write landed;
 *      acknowledge it.
 *   3. A `pending` snapshot exists and the file still matches `projected` → the
 *      write did not land; retry it.
 *   4. A `pending` snapshot exists and the file matches NEITHER → a third
 *      writer changed it. Refuse: never overwrite, keep the row's last valid
 *      executable values readable, and report the binding as blocked.
 *   5. Otherwise the file's values are authoritative. Routes are regrouped by
 *      the connection they actually describe: an unchanged group keeps its
 *      UUIDs; a changed group whose connection is SHARED with another binding
 *      clones it (detach) rather than editing a value another harness relies
 *      on; a changed group on an exclusive connection updates it in place; and
 *      a binding whose routes now disagree with each other splits.

 *      as its own fragment — never auto-linked into an existing connection.

 * one:
 *
 *   - key ABSENT  → preserve the stored secret (the client never had it)
 *   - value `null`→ an explicit clear
 *   - a string    → set it
 *
 * A client can only have learned `REDACTED_CREDENTIAL` by reading a sanitized
 * response, so echoing it back is never an intentional value. It is reported as
 * `rejected` rather than written, because storing `'***'` as the real secret
 * would break execution in a way no later edit could distinguish from a typo.
 *
