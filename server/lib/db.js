// (CREATE/ALTER/DROP) is still allowed: it is idempotent, carries no row-data,
// and ensureSchema() needs it to stand up portos_test.
//
// The first cut was `^`-anchored on a single leading verb, which let four
// less-obvious write forms slip past the "absolute backstop": data-modifying
// CTEs (`WITH … DELETE …`), `COPY … FROM` imports, `MERGE INTO`, and a write
// hiding after a leading read in a multi-statement batch (`SELECT 1; DELETE …`).
// No current store issues those forms, so this was latent rather than
// exploitable — but the guard is billed as the last line of defense, so it now
// matches a write verb ANYWHERE, after stripping comments so a keyword named in
// a comment can't trip it (and a write after a comment can't slip past).
//
// Normalize the SQL before keyword-matching in a SINGLE left-to-right pass that
// alternates over comments AND string literals, so whichever delimiter appears

// strip comments" is WRONG: an apostrophe inside a comment (`-- don't touch …`)
// would open a spurious string mask that swallows a real write on the next line
// (a false-negative — the exact failure this guard exists to prevent). Processing
// left-to-right keeps a comment's apostrophe part of the comment, and keeps a
// `/*` or `--` inside a string literal from starting a comment. Comments collapse
// to a space; string literals collapse to `''` (Postgres's escaped-quote form),
// so a write verb appearing only inside a literal can't trip the guard, and a
// quote-embedded comment delimiter can't hide a write between two literals.

  //     run unattended on every boot for a stall that only bites large-table upgrades.
