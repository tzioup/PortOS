// The manuscript-completeness, editorial-analysis, and editorial-checks runners
// each kept a near-identical ~100-LOC block: a `runs` Map keyed by seriesId, a
// `scheduleCleanup` that lingers a finished run for terminal-frame replay (with
// an identity guard so a restart isn't clobbered by the old run's timer), an
// `attachClient`/`cancel`/`isActive` trio, and a `start` that guards against a
// duplicate in-flight run, mints a runId + AbortController, and drives the work
// inside a fire-and-forget IIFE whose catch/finally emit `error` and schedule
// cleanup. This factory owns all of that so a fix to the replay/cancel/cleanup
// semantics can't drift between the three callers.
//
// The caller supplies only the per-run `work({ runId, signal, record, broadcast })`
// async function — it owns its own `start`/`complete`/`canceled` frames and any
// seeding; the factory owns the `error` frame, `finished` flag, and cleanup.
// (A caller whose error frame carries extra fields — e.g. `stepId`/`op`, or a
// status side-effect like the auto-runner's `updateIssue('needs-review')` — keeps
// its own try/catch inside `work` and swallows, so the factory's generic catch is
// only the safety net for an unexpected throw.)
//
// `logLabel` is interpolated into the failure log (`❌ <logLabel> failed — …`).
//
// `start(key, work, { sig, meta })` supports OPTIONAL signature-based coalescing
// for callers (e.g. storyBuilderRunner) that key a single map slot to work whose
// identity depends on more than the key. When `sig` is passed, a second kickoff
// while a run is in flight coalesces only if the signatures match; a DIFFERENT
// signature returns `{ alreadyRunning: true, conflict: true, ...meta }` (the live
// run's `meta`, e.g. `{ op }`) so the caller can refuse to bind onto unrelated
// work. Omit `sig` (the default) and any in-flight run coalesces unconditionally.
//
// Returns `{ runs, isActive, attachClient, cancel, start }`. `runs` is exposed
// so a module can re-export it as `__testing.runs`.
