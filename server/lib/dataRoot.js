/**
 * Data-root resolution + worktree-checkout detection.
 *
 * PortOS derives its "install root" (the directory that contains `data/`,
 * `data.reference/`, `scripts/`) from where the executing file lives
 * (`import.meta.url`). That silently breaks when a process boots from inside a
 * CoS agent's git worktree (`data/cos/worktrees/agent-<id>`): the checkout only
 * contains git-tracked files, so the gitignored `data/` runtime tree is empty,
 * and boot migrations resolve against a nonexistent path and crash (#1947).
 *
 * `resolveInstallRoot()` lets a real launch pin the root explicitly via the
 * `PORTOS_DATA_ROOT` env var, independent of the executing file's location, so
 * even a process booted from inside a worktree still resolves to the real
 * install. `isWorktreeRoot()` is the defensive backstop: detect a
 * worktree-rooted process so callers (boot migrations) can skip work that
 * assumes the real install tree instead of crashing.
