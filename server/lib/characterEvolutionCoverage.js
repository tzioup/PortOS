/**
 * Branch coverage for the five-stage character evolution lens (#6444, epic #6418).
 *
 * `characterEvolution.js` models what a story DECLARES about a character's
 * transformation. This module asks the branching question that declaration
 * cannot answer on its own: *on the path the viewer actually played*, was the
 * change earned?
 *
 * In a branching story transformation is not one timeline. If the commitment
 * stage is proved only on branch A, and A and B reconverge at a shared scene,
 * then a viewer who played B arrives at that scene inheriting a change they
 * never watched the character earn. That is the sharpest requirement in #6418
 * and nothing else in the codebase detects it.
 *
 * DETERMINISTIC AND PROVIDER-FREE. It is graph analysis over authored data:
 * no LLM call, no boot-time work, no background schedule. It runs from the
 * existing user-triggered review entry point
 * (`collectFableLoomEditorialDiagnostics`).
 *
 * Three rules this module deliberately does NOT break:
 *   - **The lens is optional and never a gate.** A loom with no authored lens
 *     returns `null` — no report, no findings, no stats — so its diagnostics
 *     are byte-identical to a pre-#6444 install's. Findings it does emit are
 *     reported, never folded into any pass/fail contract.
 *   - **A declared flat or tragic arc is not a defect.** `tragic-refusal` and
 *     `flat-testing` are checked for whether the refusal/constancy was TESTED
 *     on each path, never for the absence of a transformation.
 *   - **Partial coverage never reads as a pass.** Bounded-out enumeration, a
 *     cycle, or an anchor that does not resolve produces `unreviewed`, which
 *     is explicitly neither `verified` nor a defect finding.
 *
 * Reuse, not re-implementation: paths come from
 * `enumerateEpisodePlaythroughs` (already bounded by
 * `FABLELOOM_PLAYTEST_LIMITS`), and reconvergence comes from
 * `computeTopologicalNodeOrder`'s `convergenceNodeIds`. The editorial
 * collector hands its existing playthrough report straight in, so the review
 * path pays for exactly one enumeration, not two.
 *
 * `analyzeStoryOutline` is intentionally NOT consulted: the outline/teleplay
 * sync contract makes an expanded scene key identical to its node id, so the
 * node graph is the only playable surface, and an episode that has an outline
 * but no expanded scenes has nothing to walk — it reports `unreviewed` rather
 * than being judged against a second, non-playable graph.
