/**
 * Quota-burn configuration — shape, defaults, and normalization.
 *
 * Quota-burn is ONE machine-local loop that lives in PortOS itself, not a
 * per-managed-app scheduled CoS task type (it used to be the latter; migration
 * 221 moves installs over). The work it dispatches may still target a managed
 * app — an `agent-prompt` burn job names the app it runs in — but the schedule,
 * the provider-family windows, and the ordered job list are all install-level
 * config held here.
 *
 * Pure module: shape + normalization only, no storage and no provider I/O, so
 * the route validator, the store, the runner, and the client can all agree on
 * one vocabulary. `server/services/quotaBurnStore.js` persists it;
 * `server/services/quotaBurnRunner.js` executes it.
 *
 * Normalization is TOTAL and never throws: every read path (config file written
 * by an older PortOS, a migrated per-app override, a PUT body) funnels through
 * `normalizeQuotaBurnConfig`, which fills every family key and drops anything
 * it cannot make sense of. Absent is never confused with "off" — a family the
 * user has not configured materializes with `enabled: false`, and an unknown
 * job type is DROPPED rather than silently coerced to a different one (running
 * the wrong burn job spends real quota on work nobody asked for).

 *    plan), but it normalizes to unavailable with a migration reason. It is
 *    never rewritten into a reference here: guessing which scheduled task a
 *    hand-edited prompt meant would either strand the user's edits or duplicate

 * Returns `null` for a payload that names NEITHER — the caller drops it rather
 * than substituting a default: a step that runs the wrong work spends real
 * subscription quota on something the user never asked for, which is strictly
 * worse than the step disappearing from the list.
 *
 * `index` seeds a stable id for a step written before ids existed (or by a
 * hand-edited file), so the client's list keys and the run ledger have
 * something to key on.
 *
 * **Overrides and their compat mirrors.** `overrides` is the canonical home for
 * provider / model / effort / params, but the shipped editor still reads and
 * writes them at the TOP level (it moves to `overrides` in #6382), so both are
 * emitted and kept in lockstep here. The tie-break is presence, not truthiness:
 * a payload that CARRIES a top-level key wins with it — including when the user
 * just cleared it to `null` — and only a payload with no top-level key at all
 * falls through to `overrides`. Reading truthiness instead would resurrect the
