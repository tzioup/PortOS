/**
 * Client ↔ server API route parity.
 *
 * `client/src/services/api*.js` is where the browser learns which URL a feature
 * lives at, and each wrapper's co-located test asserts the wrapper produced the
 * string the wrapper produces. Nothing compared those strings to the routes
 * `server/index.js` actually mounts, so renaming an `app.use('/api/<x>', …)`
 * prefix — or moving a handler between routers — left the whole client suite
 * green while the feature 404'd in the browser (#5716).
 *
 * This closes that boundary by diffing two static scans of the real tree:
 * `apiRouteGraph.js` for the mounted server routes (the inventory the API
 * Explorer serves) and `clientApiPaths.js` for the paths the client wrappers
 * request. Both are derived fresh from source here, so neither side can be a
 * stale copy of the tree it describes.
