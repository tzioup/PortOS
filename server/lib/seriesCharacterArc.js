/**
 * Per-character story arcs for a series (#1293).
 *
 * Sibling to `storyArc.js` — that module owns the *series-level* temporal spine
 * (the multi-season arc + the protagonist's single emotional fortune curve);
 * this one owns the *per-character* arcs: each cast member's want/need, their
 * start → end transformation, and the explicit transition beats where they
 * actually change (a decision, a realization, a point of no return).
 *
 * Where today arc lives only at the series level (`storyArc.js` protagonistArc,
 * readerMap beats) and `editorialAnalysis.js` *detects* a coarse per-character
 * arc direction (rising/falling/flat/complex), this is the AUTHORED model the
 * writer maintains and the `arc.transitions` editorial check reconciles detected
 * change moments against.
 *
 * Shape (lives at `series.characterArcs[]`):
 *   {
 *     characterId,       // 'chr-<uuid>' pointer into the linked universe cast (or '')
 *     characterName,     // denormalized display name (canon name may rename)
 *     want,              // the external goal the character pursues
 *     need,              // the internal lesson/change they actually require
 *     startState,        // who they are at the opening
 *     endState,          // who they are at the close
 *     transitions: [{ id, atIssue, atSceneAnchor, label, kind, note }],
 *     evolution,         // the optional five-stage lens, absent when unset (#6440)
 *     status,            // 'draft' | 'verified'
 *   }
 *
 * `transitions[].kind` is one of TRANSITION_KINDS — the genre of change beat.
 *
 * Used by `services/pipeline/series.js` (sanitize on load/save) and the
 * `arc.transitions` editorial check in `lib/editorial/checkRegistry.js`.
 *
 * A pure leaf: the browser bundle imports `CHARACTER_ARC_LIMITS`,
 * `TRANSITION_KINDS` and `TRANSITION_KIND_LABELS` from here (the arc editor in
 * `PipelineSeries.jsx` caps its inputs at the numbers the PATCH route enforces),
 * so this module must reach no Node built-in — ids come from `uuid.js`, which
 * reads the global WebCrypto (the browser never mints one) — and
 * `scripts/client-server-import-purity.test.js` walks its import graph.
