/**
 * Shared source-comparison helpers for server↔client "mirror" parity tests.
 *
 * A shared PURE module is imported, not copied — the client re-exports the
 * `server/lib` leaf (see "One pure module, one definition" in
 * client/src/lib/README.md), so it needs no parity test at all. What is left are
 * the pairs that cannot be one module: a vocabulary restated in a React
 * component's constants file, or a table a service and a page each own. Each of
 * those is pinned by a `<name>.mirror.test.js` that extracts the mirrored
 * declarations from both files and diffs them with comments stripped, so
 * per-side commentary can diverge but logic cannot.
 *
 * Reach for this only when the two sides genuinely cannot be one module. If they
 * can, move the logic into a pure `server/lib` leaf and delete the copy.
 *
 * Every such test needs the same two primitives, and hand-rolling them per
 * mirror means a bug in the brace-walker has to be found and fixed once per
 * copy — copies that had already drifted (one handled `async function`, the
 * other counted brackets) before this was extracted.
 *
 * Deliberately pure — no `vitest` import — so the server/lib barrel does not
 * pull a test framework into production. Callers own the assertions.

 * `function f(a)` — the closing paren of the PARAMETER LIST — so the entire
