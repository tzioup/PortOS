/**
 * OpenCode configuration helpers.
 *
 * OpenCode (the CLI) requires every model addressable via `--model` to be
 * declared in its config. For a custom `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` provider
 * (how we wire the local Ollama daemon and MTPLX), models live UNDER the
 * provider entry
 * as `provider.<id>.models.<bareModelId>` — there is no top-level `models` map
 * in OpenCode's schema, and the keys are the BARE model id (the part after the
 * `provider/` namespace), NOT the `ollama/`-prefixed form passed to `--model`.
 *
 * The shipped `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` declared the Ollama provider but omitted
 * that models map, so OpenCode (>=1.17) rejected every `--model ollama/<id>` as
 * "Model ollama/… is not valid" — the pasted prompt sat in the input box and
 * the agent produced zero output (issue -2190). This module builds the config
 * dynamically at spawn time, declaring the provider's configured models (+ the
 * model being run) under
 * `provider.<local-backend>.models` with bare ids.
 *
 * **The custom-provider shape above is still the supported one** — re-verified
 * against OpenCode 1.18.27, where a config carrying the models map round-trips a
 * local Ollama model fine. What CHANGED is the diagnostic: the same undeclared
 * model that used to say "Model ollama/… is not valid" now fails as an opaque
 *
 *     {"name":"UnknownError","data":{"message":"Unexpected server error…"}}
 *
 * so a config missing the map reads like a broken provider rather than a
 * misconfigured one. It cost #6125 an investigation; do not re-derive it. Two
 * OTHER failures land in the same "spawns, ~12s, no output" shape and are NOT
 * this one — `model '<id>' not found` (the daemon no longer holds that model,
 * which `services/providerReadiness.js` now reports up front) and
 * `<id> does not support tools` (a non-tool-capable model, which the
 * `_fetchOllamaToolCapableModels` refresh filters out of the provider's list).
