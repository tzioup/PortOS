/**
 * Quota-burn PROVENANCE carried on an on-demand scheduled-task request, and the
 * metadata an on-demand engine stamps from it.
 *
 * A burn step no longer queues its own synthesized task: it asks the schedule to
 * run a task the user already owns (`quotaBurnInvoke.js` →
 * `taskSchedule.triggerOnDemandTask` with `origin: 'quota-burn'`). Acceptance is
 * therefore ASYNCHRONOUS — the request lands on the schedule now and one of the
 * two on-demand engines (`cos.js#spawnDequeuePriority0OnDemand`,
 * `cosTaskGenerator.js#spawnPriority0OnDemand`) generates the task later — so
 * the "which burn was this?" facts have to ride ON the request and be stamped
 * onto the task the engine produces.
 *
 * Pure, and deliberately import-light (`objects.js` only): `taskScheduleConstants.js`
 * declares the origin strings and is reached by a large share of the server suite,
 * so this module must never pull the quota-burn config graph in behind it
 * (server/AGENTS.md, "Import scoping"). That is also why `onDemandOrigin` below
 * is copied through as an opaque string rather than validated against the enum.
 *
 * These are the same provenance keys the retired `quotaBurnJobs/agentPrompt.js`
 * executor stamped, on purpose: `cosTaskGenerator.js#isCooldownExemptTask`, the
 * runner's completion continuation, and `quotaBurnDenials.js` all read them off
 * the finished agent, and they had to keep arriving unchanged when the burn's
 * origin moved (#6381) or a burn would have stopped being cooldown-exempt and a
 * refusal would have been credited to nobody. `QUOTA_BURN_PROVENANCE_FIELDS` below is the one place they
 * are named.

/**
 * THE quota-burn provenance block: the facts that say which burn a task is, in

 * rather than naming keys, so a fifth fact is one row here instead of four
 * hand-written lines that can each be forgotten independently — which is exactly
 * how `quotaBurnStepId` came to reach disk but never reach the agent (#6406).
 *
 * The three hops:
 *   - `onDemandRequestMetadata` below (raw path — the on-demand engines).
 *   - `cosTaskStore.js#addTask` (non-raw path — the synchronous custom-job lane).
 *   - `agentLifecycle.js` (the agent projection the runner and the denial
 *     ledger read a finished run back out of).
 *
 * The PERSISTED and cross-peer shape stays FLAT (`quotaBurnFamily`, …), not a
 * nested `quotaBurn` object. CoS tasks federate as markdown replicated between
 * peers that upgrade independently (`cosTaskMerge.js`), and `metadata.quotaBurnFamily`
 * is what makes a burn cooldown-exempt and what credits a refusal to a family —
 * so a nested-only write would make a burn queued on a new peer read as an
 * ordinary task on an older one, for no functional gain. `quotaBurnProvenance`
 * still ACCEPTS a nested block, so a producer may hand its provenance over as a
 * unit and a task that ever arrives in that shape resolves identically.
 *
 * Readers coerce, because a COS-TASKS.md round-trip hands every scalar back as a
 * string: a task written by a previous release must still read as burn-provenanced.

/**
 * Normalize the `burn` block of an on-demand request. Returns `null` unless it

 * unattributable burn is worse than no burn: `isCooldownExemptTask` would treat
 * an ordinary task as burn-exempt, and the denial ledger would credit a refusal
 * to the wrong family.
 *
 * `overrides` carries the three per-invocation settings the generated task can
 * absorb AFTER generation — the provider, model and reasoning effort the spawner
 * reads straight off `task.metadata` — plus the step's run `params`.
 *
 * The params are here for a reason the other three are not: they have to reach
 * the PROMPT, so they cannot ride the post-generation
 * `onDemandRequestMetadata` stamp below. Both on-demand engines pull them off
 * the request and hand them to `generateManagedAppImprovementTaskForType` as
 * `runOverrides`, which layers them over the task's saved `taskMetadata` BEFORE
 * the mode banner is chosen and the prompt is rendered. That is what lets a step
 * migrated from an issues-only burn preset pin `fileIssues: true` explicitly and
 * keep filing even against an audit type whose shipped scheduled default is
 * `false` (#6381) — without it a migrated burn would silently run the task's
 * saved mode and start writing code.
 *
 * Shallow scalars only, and validated for real one hop later: the generator
 * sanitizes them through `sanitizeTaskMetadata`'s allowlist, the same door a
 * stored override passes. Copied here rather than imported from
 * `quotaBurnTaskRef.js` so this module keeps its one-import budget — it is
 * reached by a large share of the server suite.

 * be the worst of both: `isCooldownExemptTask` would treat an ordinary human Run
