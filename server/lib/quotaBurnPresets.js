/**
 * Ready-made work prompts for `agent-prompt` burn jobs.
 *
 * A burn window is a use-it-or-lose-it budget, and the thing it is worst at is
 * open-ended "do something useful" work: an agent with a vague prompt spends a
 * whole window rediscovering the repo. These presets are the opposite — each is
 * ONE narrow audit dimension (the single-focus form of `/do:better --issues`)
 * that reads real code, files decision-complete GitHub issues, and changes
 * nothing. That shape suits an unattended window: the output is a queue another
 * agent can drain later, so a burn that lands at 3am needs no review to be safe.
 *
 * TEMPLATES, not references. Picking a preset COPIES its prompt into the job's
 * own `params.prompt`, which the user then edits freely. Nothing on disk points
 * back at a preset id, so editing the text here never rewrites a configured job
 * on any install and there is no migration to write — the cost is that an
 * improved prompt reaches existing jobs only when the user re-picks the preset.
 *
 * A contract change that must reach EXISTING jobs therefore needs a migration.
 * Two exist, and the second supersedes the first's matching rule:
 *
 * - Migration 294 (#4852, the CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md rename) matched a stored
 *   prompt byte-for-byte against a reconstructed prior render. That rule turned
 *   out to be too strict to be useful: a job seeded two contract revisions ago
 *   matches no single reconstructed render, so 294 skipped every real job on
 *   this install as "user-edited" and they kept running a prompt that predated
 *   the dispatch-label guidance entirely — which is why a whole quota-burn
 *   backlog arrived with no `model:`/`effort:` routing on it.
 * - Migration 305 matches on the MISSION half instead (everything above
 *   `## How to run this audit`, the part that says WHAT to audit) and replaces
 *   the contract half, which is the part this file owns and revises. That rule
 *   is `matchStoredAuditPreset` below, shared with #6381's conversion so
 *   "still a shipped preset" means one thing. Copy that
 *   migration for the next contract edit rather than 294's.
 *
 * Pure module: strings only, no I/O. `routes/quotaBurn.js` serves the list in
 * the config catalog; the client's preset picker applies one to a job row.

${AUDIT_CONTRACT_HEADING}

Most of this window belongs to RESEARCH, not to filing. Two issues another agent
can execute cold — trigger named, fix decided, files listed — are worth more than
five it has to re-investigate from scratch. Spend roughly the first two thirds of
the window reading and tracing, and only then start filing.

1. **Pick a bounded slice and say so first.** Do NOT attempt the whole
   repository. Choose one coherent area (a feature directory, a route group, a
   handful of related screens) — prefer one that recent audit issues have not
   already covered — and open your report by naming the slice in one line.
2. **Research each candidate before you judge it.** Read the whole file, not the
   lines your search matched. Trace the value end to end: where it is set, who
   else reads it, and what each caller does when it fails. Read the tests that
   already cover it, and check \`git log -n 5 -- <file>\` for why the code is
   shaped the way it is — code that looks wrong is often load-bearing. Drop any
   candidate you cannot walk through this way; a hunch is not a finding.
3. **Prove the trigger.** Every finding must cite \`path/to/file.js:LINE\` and
   name the path that actually reaches it — which user action, route, event, or
   scheduled job, in what state — plus what goes wrong and who notices. If you
   cannot name a reachable trigger, the finding is a guess: delete it. That
   filter is the whole point of this job.
4. **Decide the fix before you file it.** Name the approach, every file it
   touches, and the tests to add or change. Where you had a real choice, say
   which option you rejected and why in one line. If the only obstacle was a
   design decision, make the call — do not file a question.
5. **De-duplicate before filing.** Run
   \`gh issue list --state open --limit 200 --search "${dedupeSearch}"\` (and a
   plain keyword search per finding). If it is already filed, skip it; comment on
   the existing issue only when you have genuinely new evidence.
6. **File each surviving finding as its own issue.** Write the body to a scratch
   file OUTSIDE the repository — \`BODY=$(mktemp)\` — then create with repeated
   \`--label\` flags:
   \`gh issue create --title "..." --body-file "$BODY" --label ...\`. Keep scratch
   files out of the working tree: you are running in the repository's OWN
   checkout, on the branch it is currently on — not a throwaway copy — so
   anything you leave behind is left in the user's working tree. Category
   labels (create each missing one immediately before applying it —
   \`gh label create <name> --color 0366D6 2>/dev/null || true\`):
   ${labels}. Then the required dispatch labels.
   ${MANDATORY_DISPATCH_HINT_GUIDANCE.split('\n').join(' ')} One problem per
   issue — never a bundle. Do not relabel an existing issue you skipped as a
   duplicate.
7. **Bodies must be decision-complete**, in this shape:
   - **Problem** — what is wrong, with file:line references.
   - **Trigger** — the path that reaches it: the action, the state, the caller.
   - **Impact** — the user-visible consequence, not the code smell.
   - **Fix** — the approach you have DECIDED on, the files it touches, the tests
     to add or change, and the alternative you rejected with a one-line
     rationale. Do not file a question.
   - **Acceptance criteria** — checkboxes another agent can verify cold.
8. **Cap yourself at 5 issues, and aim for two or three.** Depth is the
   deliverable: a handful of researched, ready-to-work issues is worth more than
   a wall of nits, and a long tail of low-value issues costs a human real triage
   time. Fewer than 5 real problems? File fewer, and spend the time you save
   going deeper on the ones you keep or widening the slice you researched.
9. **Redact before you publish.** An issue is world-readable the moment it is
   filed. Never paste a secret, credential, token, hostname, IP address, absolute
   path containing a username, or any personal record into a title or body — cite
   the location and redact the value (\`<token>\`, \`<hostname>\`, \`<user-email>\`).
   For a LIVE credential, do not file an ordinary issue at all: a public tracker
   entry naming the file and line is a world-readable map to a working secret.
   Report it in your final summary to the user, say it needs rotating, and file
   at most a location-free issue ("a committed credential needs rotating and
   purging from history — details in the run summary").
10. **Change no code.** No edits, no commits, no branches, no pull requests, and
   no \`git checkout\`/\`switch\` — you are standing in the user's live checkout of
   this repository, so an edit or a branch change is felt immediately by whoever
   is working in it. The deliverable is the filed issues, and the run must end
   with the same \`git status\` and the same branch it started on.
11. **Report at the end**: the slice you audited, what you traced and ruled out,
   each issue number and title, and anything you deliberately did not file and
   why.

If \`gh\` cannot reach the network (errors like "bad file descriptor" or a
connect timeout), do not give up silently — fall back to the REST API with the
token from the local keyring:
\`TOK=$(command gh auth token)\`, then with the JSON payload in \`BODY=$(mktemp)\`:
\`curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -d @"$BODY" https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues\`.
A window spent finding real problems and filing none is a wasted window.

Read this repository's \`AGENTS.md\` (or \`CLAUDE.md\`, and any nested
per-directory ones covering the slice) before you start, and honor its
conventions and its explicitly declared non-issues — a finding that contradicts
a documented project decision is noise, not a bug.`.trim();

GitHub issues. You are not fixing anything this run.

Work from the UI code (components, pages, drawers, forms) and reason about it as
the person using it, not as the person who wrote it. Hunt specifically for:

- **Controls that do something surprising.** An icon-only button that spends
  money, deletes data, or dispatches work with no confirmation, no label, and no
  distinction from the harmless controls beside it.
- **Invisible state.** A surface that auto-saves with nothing on screen saying
  so; a mutation with no confirmation; a background job whose progress is
  guessable only from a spinner; "did that work?" moments generally.
- **Disabled with no reason.** A button greyed out where the only explanation is
  a \`title\` tooltip (invisible on touch) or nothing at all.
- **Lost work.** Navigation, tab switches, or drawer closes that discard an
  unsaved edit; forms that clear on error; optimistic updates that silently
  revert.
- **Dead ends.** Empty states that suggest no next action, errors that state a
  failure without a remedy, filters that can produce a blank screen with no way
  back.
- **Inconsistency with the rest of the app.** The same concept spelled two ways,
  a hand-rolled clone of a shared component, a flow that breaks the conventions
  the project's UI docs describe.
- **Reachability.** A view that cannot be linked to, bookmarked, or reached from
  the command palette / navigation because its selection lives in local state.

  \`onClick\` and no \`role\`, \`tabIndex\`, or Enter/Space handling.
- **Unlabeled controls** — icon-only buttons with no \`aria-label\`, inputs whose
  label is styled text rather than a real \`<label htmlFor>\`/\`id\` pair, form
  fields whose only cue is a placeholder.
- **Focus management** — modals and drawers that do not take focus, do not
  restore it on close, or let Tab escape behind the overlay; a destructive
  confirm the keyboard reaches before the cancel.
- **State that only exists visually** — validation errors, async status, and
  live updates that never reach a screen reader (no \`aria-live\`,
  \`aria-invalid\`, \`aria-expanded\`, \`aria-busy\`).
- **Contrast and sizing** — low-contrast secondary text against the app's
  background, text below ~12px carrying real meaning, meaning conveyed by color
  alone.
- **Motion and autoplay** — animation or autoplaying media that ignores
  \`prefers-reduced-motion\`.

- **Touch targets** — interactive elements smaller than ~44px, or packed so
  tightly that the destructive one sits under the thumb.
- **Hover-only information** — anything whose meaning lives in a \`title\` or a
  hover tooltip, which touch users never see. Disabled-button explanations and

- **Modals, drawers, and menus** that assume desktop width instead of becoming a
  full-screen sheet, or whose scroll region is the page rather than the panel.

  configuration on a short viewport.

  user nothing, so a failed save looks exactly like a successful one.
- **Doubled or missing feedback** — a request helper that toasts AND a caller
  that toasts (two toasts for one failure), or a mutation that toasts neither.
- **Absent vs. empty conflated** — a fetch that failed rendering as "you have
  none", a cache that cannot tell "not loaded" from "loaded, legitimately zero",
  a merge where a missing key clears a value the user set.
- **Stale UI after a mutation** — a list that keeps the deleted row, a detail
  view still showing pre-save values, a status that never clears on failure.
- **Unsaved-work loss** — a debounced save dropped on unmount, an edit discarded
  by a tab switch or a refetch that overwrites in-flight typing.

Chase work that scales badly, not micro-optimizations:

- **Repeated expensive scans** — the same directory walk, file parse, or
  aggregation performed twice in one request, or on every poll.
- **Unbounded growth** — lists, logs, caches, or in-memory maps with no cap;
  responses that serialize an entire collection to render a picker that needs
  two fields.
- **Render storms** — state updated on every keystroke or every socket frame
  with no debounce/batching, context values rebuilt each render, expensive
  derived values recomputed unmemoized in a hot component.
- **Timers and polling** — intervals that keep running after unmount, poll
  frequencies far tighter than the data changes, backoff-free retry loops.
- **Leaks** — subscriptions, listeners, PTYs, or GPU/media resources allocated
  without a matching teardown.

  regression test is the highest-value gap on this list.
- **Shape-dense code** — where reviewers keep finding a new failing input,
  propose a property test over generated inputs rather than more example cases.

it declares something a non-issue for this deployment (an omitted control, a
documented default, an accepted risk), do not file it — a window spent re-filing
an explicitly closed concern is worse than a window spent idle.

What is worth filing:

- **Secrets in the wrong place** — credentials, tokens, or keys that could reach
  a commit, a log line, a bundled client asset, a shared artifact, or an
  outbound request that had no business carrying them.
- **Command and path injection** — user-controlled input reaching a shell, a
  path join, or a dynamic import without validation; an allowlist that a crafted
  value can walk out of.
- **Destructive operations with too little scoping** — a delete, overwrite, or
  reset whose target is computed rather than constrained, especially where a
  test or dev path could aim it at real data.
- **Trust boundaries that are actually crossed** — data arriving from another
  machine, a third-party API, or a model response being used without validation
  where a malformed or hostile value would do damage.
- **Dependency exposure** — a known-vulnerable package on a path that actually

  object literals triggering runaway render loops.

# Observability audit — file issues, change nothing

Audit how this application logs events, reports runtime failures, and surfaces
diagnostics, and file the gaps as GitHub issues. No code changes this run.

Trace error handling and log statements:

- **Silent failure swallowing** — \`catch\` blocks discarding errors with no
  logging or telemetry, hiding failures in production.
- **Log noise & console spam** — polling loops, socket frames, or hot render
  paths emitting lines on every tick, burying actionable errors.
- **Missing error context** — errors logged with only \`err.message\` while
  omitting task IDs, universe IDs, route paths, or stack traces.
- **Inconsistent log levels** — fatal runtime errors logged as \`console.log\`
  instead of \`console.error\` / structured error loggers.
- **Uninstrumented workflows** — multi-step background pipelines or agent
  transitions with no progress logging, leaving stuck jobs invisible.

For each finding, cite the catch block or uninstrumented workflow and explain
what operational blindspot it creates.`,

# Copy clarity audit — file issues, change nothing

Audit user-facing copy, labels, tooltips, dialogs, and error messages for
clarity, accuracy, and consistency, and file them as GitHub issues. No code changes.

Review user-facing UI text:

- **Internal jargon** — technical variable names, database keys, or protocol
  details leaking into UI labels where domain terms belong.
- **Ambiguous action labels** — generic "OK"/"Submit" on destructive actions
  instead of explicit verbs ("Delete", "Discard"), or misleading "Cancel" buttons.
- **Dead-end error messages** — "Failed" or "Invalid request" without explaining
  what was wrong or how the user can resolve it.
- **Broken pluralization** — "1 items", "0 files deleted", or "found 1 results"
  missing singular/plural branching.
- **Inconsistent terminology** — the same entity or action named differently
  across tabs, dialogs, and navigation.
- **Clipped labels** — text containers with fixed widths cutting off words.
