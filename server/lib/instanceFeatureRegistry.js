// The registry of optional per-install features — the single list that Settings
// > Features renders, `server/lib/validation.js` validates against, and
// `server/lib/navManifest.js` gates navigation on.
//
// It lives in lib/ (pure data, no I/O) so both a lib and a service can read it
// without a service→lib inversion. Runtime resolution — stored overrides,
// auto-detection, the enabled/disabled answer — is
// `server/services/instanceFeatures.js`.
//
// Adding a feature:
//   1. add a descriptor here;
//   2. tag its pages in navManifest.js (`feature: '<id>'`, or a SECTION_FEATURE
//      entry when a whole sidebar section belongs to it) — sidebar rows derive
//      their feature gate from navManifest directly, so no matching edit is
//      needed in client/src/components/Layout.jsx;
//   3. add a `detect` hook in services/instanceFeatures.js when a fresh install
//      should infer the default from whether the integration is configured.
// The validation schemas and the install-wide Features tab pick it up with no
// further edit; managed-app tabs opt into the separate APP_FEATURE_IDS list
// below when they need an app-level inherit/override control.
//
// A feature may carry `group: '<groupId>'` to bucket it under one of
// INSTANCE_FEATURE_GROUPS below. A grouped feature keeps its own tri-state
// override (inherit/on/off, same stored-`enabled` shape every feature already
// uses) but ALSO inherits its group's `enabled` flag when its own override is
// untouched: group off hides every member that has not overridden on, group on
// hands each member back to its own normal resolution (detector, then
// `defaultEnabled`). See resolveOne in services/instanceFeatures.js. An
// ungrouped feature is completely unaffected — this is additive.
