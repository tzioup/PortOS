/**
 * The OPTIONAL five-stage character evolution lens (#6440, epic #6418).
 *
 * A story-scoped craft lens layered over the universe-level psychology profile
 * in `characterFramework.js` (Ghost → Wound → Lie → Want → Need, theory of
 * control, drives). That profile is the character's baseline IDENTITY and is
 * owned by the universe; this module models what ONE story does to it — the
 * belief it puts under test, the pressure it applies, the choice the character
 * makes, and what that choice causes. A series/work/branch's realized change
 * must never be written back over world-level identity, which is why the lens
 * hangs off the story record (`series.characterArcs[].evolution`,
 * `loom.seriesPlan.characterEvolutions[]`) and links to the cast by character
 * id alone.
 *
 * Deliberate non-rules, carried from #6418:
 *   - The lens is OPTIONAL. Every arc, beat structure and authored transition
 *     kind stays valid with it unset; nothing here becomes a gate.
 *   - The five stages are a craft lens over authored beats, NOT a page count,
 *     a chapter count, or a percentage layout.
 *   - The changed belief need not be the literal negation of the tested one.
 *   - Not every character transforms. `tragic-refusal`, `flat-testing` and
 *     `partial-open` are DECLARED outcomes, not defects — declaring one is what
 *     stops a downstream review reading a deliberate flat arc as a gap.
 *   - Stages are SPARSE: a lens with only stages 1 and 3 authored is valid.
 *
 * A PURE LEAF (imports only `bibleLimits.js` + the dependency-free trim
 * helpers in `textUtils.js`), matching `characterFramework.js`, so
 * `client/src/lib/characterEvolution.js` can re-export the vocabularies into
 * the browser bundle without dragging `crypto` / `fileUtils` along. That
 * purity is why a stage has no minted uuid: `stageId` is the identity (one
 * record per stage per lens), which needs no id generator and keeps a
 * round trip byte-stable.
 *
 * Embedded by `seriesCharacterArc.js` (`series.characterArcs[].evolution`),
 * `services/fableLoom/records.js` (`loom.seriesPlan.characterEvolutions[]`) and
 * `lib/storyBible.js`'s `sanitizeCharacter` (`characters[].evolution`, which is
 * how a Writers Room work carries the lens per work WITHOUT being promoted to a
 * Pipeline series — #6445), all of which sanitize on load/save/sync.
