// Beeper conversation mirror DDL (#27). Machine-local mirror of the Beeper
// Desktop API (accounts, conversations, messages, participants, attachment
// metadata, and per-chat sync cursors), plus two tables that are not mirror
// data: the credential vault (`beeper_credentials`, #31) and the send outbox
// (`beeper_outbox`). Carries the schema decisions from the Beeper wayfinder
// map (#1); rationale lives on #7 (store shape), #10 (Tribe handles), #12
// (transport), #13 (attachments) — not repeated here.
//
// NEVER FEDERATED — enforced by beeperNeverFederates.test.js. No table here
// gets a `sync_sequence` column, a PEER_SUBSCRIBABLE_KINDS entry, a dataSync
// snapshot category, or a PORTOS_SCHEMA_VERSIONS entry.
//
// Deletions from the source are tombstones, not removals: a message the
// source unsends keeps its row, body, and attachments and gains `unsent_at`
// — the column is named for what the source actually reports, and an archive
// that quietly forgets a caption while keeping its photo is not trustworthy.
// Because the inbound tombstone is `unsent_at`, the federation guard keys on
// `sync_sequence` alone and needs no soft-delete exemption. See the ADR
// landing alongside #7 for the full argument.
