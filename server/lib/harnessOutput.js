/**
 * Parsers for what a coding-agent HARNESS prints about itself — its version
 * banner and its model catalog.
 *
 * A harness is the CLI/TUI binary a provider shells out to (`opencode`,
 * `claude`, `codex`, `agy`, `grok`, `kimi`, `cursor-agent`). PortOS could
 * already answer "is it on PATH?" (`services/providerRuntimeInstaller.js`); the
 * Harnesses page also needs "which version, and which models does THIS install
 * of it know about?" — and every vendor answers both in its own shape.
 *
 * Pure on purpose: no spawning, no filesystem, no network. The service layer
 * runs the child and hands the captured stdout here, which keeps the vendor
 * output shapes pinned by cheap table-driven tests instead of by running six
 * real binaries in CI.
 *
 * **Model ids come back in the exact spelling `--model` takes.** OpenCode names
 * its models `provider/model` and accepts that form verbatim, so the namespace
 * is KEPT; Antigravity and Grok name theirs bare and take them bare. Stripping
 * or adding a namespace here would produce a list the harness itself rejects.
 *
 * **A vendor whose stdout already has a parser DELEGATES to it.** Antigravity's
 * and Cursor's live in `antigravity.js` and `aiToolkit/internal/cursor.js`,
 * where the provider-card refresh has used them for far longer than this page
 * has existed. A second copy here would be a third and fourth transcription of
 * one vendor's output — and would have been wrong on arrival: the agy parser
 * accepts an older build's bare-id-per-line rows and drops the
 * `<configured-default>` sentinel, neither of which a fresh reading of today's
 * TAB-separated output would have known to do.

 * of them contain exactly one `x.y.z` run. Anchored on a word boundary so a
 * build hash (`5e9a58528b76`) or a date fragment inside a longer token cannot
 * be read as the version.
 *
 * `null` (not `''`) is the NOT-KNOWN sentinel: a harness whose banner we cannot
 * parse must not read as "version unknown, therefore out of date" — the
 * update-available comparison bails on a null on either side.
