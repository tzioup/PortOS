// IC-LoRA weight registry for the local LTX-2 video runtime (issue #3100).
//
// The `ltx2` runtime already ships `ltx_pipelines_mlx.ic_lora.ICLoraPipeline`
// — a two-stage pipeline that conditions generation on a *reference video*
// channel with an IC ("In-Context") LoRA fused into Stage 1. Which capability
// you get is entirely a function of WHICH IC-LoRA weight is fused, so this
// module is the single source of truth mapping a PortOS remix mode
// (`ic-control`, …) to its weight, HF repo, reference-count rule, and the
// resolution constraint the weight's metadata imposes.
//
// Weights are NOT bundled — each is a separate multi-hundred-MB HF pull, so
// they ride the same cache-inspect / download-SSE / verify / repair surface as
// the model weights themselves (see routes/videoGen.js). `resolveIcLoraWeight`
// returns a local cached file path when present and falls back to the HF repo
// id, which ICLoraPipeline._resolve_lora_path resolves on its own — so a render
// still works if the user skipped the explicit pre-download (it just stalls
// silently on the pull instead of showing progress).
//
// The repo-id fallback is NOT universally safe: `_resolve_lora_path` implements
// it as `snapshot_download(repo_id)`, which pulls the ENTIRE repo. That's fine
// for a single-weight repo (Control, Colorize) and catastrophic for an aggregate
// mirror — `DeepBeepMeep/LTX-2` carries every LTX weight in one ~708 GB repo. A
// spec whose chain includes such a repo sets `requiresPreDownload`, and
// resolveIcLoraWeight then refuses to emit a bare repo id at all (see below).
//
// Gating: Control and Colorize are un-gated. Ingredients' official Lightricks
// repo is gated (`gated: "auto"` — an anonymous resolve returns 401 GatedRepo),
// so `gated: true` marks it and the mirror provides an un-gated path for users
// without an HF token.

// without erroring and produces garbage rather than a clean failure.

//
// `baseModel` is which LTX release the adapter was trained against, and
// `mode` is the PortOS remix mode it is offered as — `null` for a weight that
// is not a remix mode at all (the Pixel Spatial Upscaler is an upscale
// adapter, reached from the upscale flow rather than the render form). The two
// fields are INDEPENDENT gates: `listIcLoraRemixModes` requires both.
//
// `revision` pins the HF commit the weight is fetched and cache-resolved at.
// `null` means unpinned — the historical behavior for the 2.3 weights, which
// resolve out of whatever snapshot the install happens to hold.
//
// `referenceDownscaleFactor` is informational (the pipeline reads the real
// value from the weight's safetensors metadata): the IC encoder divides the
// reference clip by it, and it requires the OUTPUT height/width to be
// divisible by that factor — so surfacing it lets the route reject a bad
// resolution up-front instead of failing deep inside the pipeline. It is
// PER-WEIGHT and must be READ from the weight's `__metadata__`, never copied
// from a sibling entry: Union-Control ships 2, the Colorizer ships 1.
//
// The MIRRORED fields (label/description/referenceKind/uploadLabel/the counts/
// the factor) are duplicated in client/src/lib/videoGenParams.js so the form can

// here can't silently leave the client accepting what the server rejects. That
