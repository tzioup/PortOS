/**
 * The shared cast-integrity contract (#6415).
 *
 * "Every field is filled" and "this character holds together" are different
 * questions, and until now only the first had an answer. `missingBibleFields`
 * counts blanks; `applyExpansion` fills blanks; neither can say that a fully
 * populated profile states a control belief its own behavior contradicts, or
 * that its three drives are the same sentence written three ways.
 *
 * This module is the vocabulary both questions report in, so one report shape
 * reaches every consumer instead of each surface inventing its own:
 *
 *   - the deterministic pass (`castCompletenessFindings`) — NO provider calls,
 *     safe to run on every load
 *   - the semantic pass (`mergeSemanticFindings`) — an explicitly invoked LLM
 *     review, validated back into the same finding shape
 *
 * PURE: shape, predicates and merges only. No storage, no provider I/O, no
 * universe/series/work concepts — the callers own those, which is what lets
 * Universe Bible, Series, FableLoom and Writers Room share one contract.
 *
 * The vocabulary itself — finding kinds, review statuses, depths, the five
 * semantic dimensions and `castIntegrityPassed` — lives in
 * `characterIntegrityVocabulary.js`, a browser-safe leaf the report UI imports
 * directly; this module reaches Node built-ins through `storyBible.js`.
 *
 * Reports are DERIVED, never persisted, so `characterFingerprint` is what keeps
 * a repair honest: a proposal carries the fingerprint of the character it was
 * reviewed against, and applying it to a record that has since changed is
 * refused rather than silently overwriting the newer edit.
