 *      claude-code-tui CoS agent failed `paste-not-rendered` after 3 retries
 *      because #2192's text-only check never saw the collapsed body — while the
 *      marker was sitting right there. (agent-656efa6e et al.)
 *   1b. The COLLAPSED-CHIP shape (`isCollapsedPasteChip`) — a marker present
 *      alongside Claude's "paste again to expand" affordance. This rescues the
 *      subtraction's blind spot: when the prompt ITSELF embeds `[Pasted text #N]`
 *      literals AND is multi-line, Claude folds it into its own single chip and
 *      hides the body, so `count (1) > promptMarkerCount (1)` is false — yet the
 *      collapse chrome proves the visible marker is the TUI's own commit. The
 *      chrome never rides in on an echoed prompt literal, so this can't
 *      re-introduce the echoed-marker false-positive the subtraction guards
 *      (issue #2228; the inline/uncollapsed echo path has no such chrome and keeps
 *      subtracting).
 *   2. Fallback for the MARKERLESS path — a paste too small to render the marker,
 *      or one genuinely SWALLOWED by a still-initializing TUI (the #2192 case,
 *      which renders no marker at all): fall back to confirming the prompt text

//
// Codex (unlike Claude Code) boots any MCP servers configured in the user's
// GLOBAL `~/.codex/config.toml` on every startup — INCLUDING for our headless
// CoS agents, which never asked for them. A user with heavyweight interactive
// servers (e.g. `playwright` via `npx @playwright/mcp@latest`, or a `node_repl`
// with `startup_timeout_sec = 120`) makes codex spend tens of seconds — up to
// two minutes — booting that stack before its input box will accept a paste.
//
// During that boot codex renders its input box EARLY but SWALLOWS pastes, and
// while it waits on a silent boot subprocess (an `npx` download, a stalled
// server) its PTY output goes IDLE — indistinguishable from "ready" to the
// idle-detect readiness heuristic. So the spawner pastes mid-boot, codex
// swallows it (no `[Pasted Content N chars]` marker, and its single-line input
// viewport shows only the TAIL of the long paste, never the verifiable prefix),
// and the paste-verify retry (issue #2192) exhausts its 3 short attempts and
// fails `paste-not-rendered` — killing codex BEFORE its MCP boot ever finished
// (real incident 2026-07-10: agent-c5a26b40 / agent-3f4ae3b1, both gpt-5.6-sol;
// the same prompt succeeded on 2026-07-03..09 back when no MCP servers were
// configured and codex was ready in <10s).
//
// The fix is NOT a new readiness signal (codex gives no reliable boot-complete
// one — a slow boot looks identical to a ready box) but a boot-aware RETRY
// BUDGET: once boot chrome is seen, keep re-pasting until codex finishes booting
// and a paste finally lands its marker, up to MCP_BOOT_PASTE_DEADLINE_MS. The
// spawner (agentTuiSpawning.js) consumes `createMcpBootTracker` for exactly that.
//
// Matched against ANSI-stripped output. Detection is deliberately conservative:
// a false POSITIVE only extends the
// (bounded) retry window, and a false NEGATIVE just preserves the pre-fix 3-retry

// Recovery policy for a LOCAL inference runtime that ran out of accelerator
// memory mid-turn (detectLocalRuntimeOom in aiToolkit/errorDetection.js).
//
// This is NOT the self-clearing gate above, and the difference is what the
// provider did with the turn. agy's eligibility banner REJECTS the submission:
// the composer empties, nothing is in flight, and the remedy is to re-send the
// whole prompt. A Metal/CUDA OOM kills a turn the server had already ACCEPTED:
// the TUI session still holds the entire conversation, so the remedy is a
// one-word nudge to carry on. Re-pasting the task prompt there would restart
// the task on top of the work already done.
//
// Provenance: agent-011d0c27 (2026-08-22, OpenCode on
// `mtplx/mtplx-qwen38-27b-optimized-speed`) died on
// `kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorOutOfMemory` and sat at its idle footer
// until a human typed `continue`, at which point it resumed and finished the
// turn. Nothing in the unattended path would ever have typed it — the
// long-running agent path has no idle watchdog by design ("a CoS TUI may remain
// silent for as long as the provider needs").

// How long the session must have been SILENT before a nudge goes out. This is
// the whole false-positive defense, and it is deliberately a silence test
// rather than a chrome test: the generation-activity tracker above is spelled in
// agy/claude/codex footer text that OpenCode does not paint at all (its
// in-flight chrome is an animated block wave plus an `esc interrupt` footer that
// repaints only ~8 times across a 74MB transcript), so a chrome-based recovery
// check would read a perfectly healthy OpenCode session as stuck. Silence is
// provider-agnostic and needs no per-TUI vocabulary.
