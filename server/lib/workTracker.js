// Per-app "work tracker" resolution — where a managed app's autonomous work
// items live: PLAN.md, a GitHub issue tracker, a GitLab issue tracker, or JIRA.
//
// Each managed app carries a `workTracker` field (default `'auto'`). `'auto'`
// resolves to a concrete tracker from the app's git `origin` host: a github.com
// remote → GitHub issues, a gitlab.* remote → GitLab issues, anything else (or
// no remote) → PLAN.md. JIRA is never auto-selected — it requires explicit
// per-app JIRA config (`app.jira`) — so a user picks it deliberately.
//
// The pure mappers (hostToWorkTracker / forgeCliForTracker / trackerToClaimTaskType
// / resolveWorkTracker / hostFromOriginUrl) are side-effect-free and unit-tested.
// resolveAppWorkTracker is the async wrapper that reads the app's origin URL via
// readOriginRemoteUrl and extracts the host with hostFromOriginUrl — it shells
// out to git, mirroring gitRemote.js (which also lives in lib/ despite running
// `git`). See server/services/cosTaskGenerator.js for the claim-work router
// that consumes trackerToClaimTaskType.

/**
 * Resolve which forge a repo checkout's `origin` points at, together with
 * everything a `gh`/`glab` caller needs to target it — or null when the origin
 * isn't a forge PortOS can query (no remote, or a host that is neither
 * GitHub- nor GitLab-family AND no `preferredForge` override applies — see
 * below).
 *
 * The two branches deliberately differ, mirroring how the CLIs address a repo:
 * - GitHub (incl. Enterprise) resolves through `githubRepoSpec`, whose
 *   host-qualified `HOST/OWNER/REPO` selector keeps `gh --repo` deterministic on
 *   a fork+upstream checkout and correct on enterprise hosts.
 * - GitLab is classified straight off the HOST via the subgroup-safe
 *   `hostFromOriginUrl`, NOT `getOriginInfo().fullName`: the latter's strict
 *   `owner/repo` parse returns null for a nested `group/subgroup/project`
 *   remote (the common GitLab layout), which would silently read as "not a
 *   forge" even though `glab` resolves the project from its cwd regardless.
 *   `repoSpec` is therefore null for GitLab — the caller must run `glab` in
 *   `repoPath`.
 *
 * `preferredForge` ('github' | 'gitlab' | null) is the app's EXPLICITLY
 * configured work tracker (never 'auto' — that already flows through the same
 * `hostToWorkTracker` classification above, so it would already have matched
 * here if it could). It's a fallback, tried only once both host-pattern checks
 * above have failed: a self-hosted GitHub Enterprise Server or GitLab instance
 * can run on ANY domain the operator picked (`git.mycompany.com`,
 * `scm.mycompany.com`, …) — there is no hostname heuristic that can tell such a
 * host apart from a non-forge remote, so the user's own pin is the only signal
 * left. A genuinely wrong pin (e.g. a bitbucket.org origin pinned to 'github')
 * still degrades gracefully: the resulting `gh`/`glab` call fails and the
 * caller reports a transient "couldn't reach" error rather than PortOS lying
 * upfront that the origin "isn't GitHub or GitLab".
 *
 * Never throws: a missing repo / unreadable origin degrades to null.
 * @param {string} repoPath
 * @param {{preferredForge?: 'github'|'gitlab'|null}} [options]
 * @returns {Promise<{forge:'github'|'gitlab', fullName:string, repoSpec:string|null, apiHost:string|null}|null>}

/**

 * hold the managed-app record (not just a bare `repoPath`): resolve the app's
 * work tracker, then resolve its forge target with that tracker supplied as the
 * `preferredForge` pin.
 *
 * This composition exists so a feature can't accidentally drop the pin. Threading
 * it by hand is what left the issue-reconcile scan blind to a self-hosted forge
 * whose hostname doesn't spell out "github."/"gitlab." while the app's Issues tab
 * listed it fine (issue #3767) — the pin only matters for exactly those hosts, so
 * a missing one fails silently on every ordinary github.com/gitlab.com app.
 *
 * `preferredForge` is passed ONLY for a github/gitlab tracker: a plan/jira app has
 * no forge pin to honor, and passing its tracker through would be meaningless.
 * `target` is still resolved for those apps (the origin may well be a forge) so a
 * caller that only wants the queryable repo doesn't have to special-case them —
 * callers that must gate on the tracker read `tracker` and decide.
 *
 * Never throws — both halves degrade to null rather than rejecting.
 * @param {object} app - managed app record (needs `repoPath`, `workTracker`)
 * @param {{repoPath?: string}} [options] - `repoPath` override for a caller that
 *   scans a checkout other than `app.repoPath` (the app record supplies the pin,
 *   the override supplies the checkout).
