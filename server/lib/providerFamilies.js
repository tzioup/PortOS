 * Subscription-quota FAMILY identity: which provider configs belong to the same

 * This is the pure half of the registry `server/services/providerUsage.js`
 * drives — that service attaches a `fetch` per family, and those fetches spawn
 * PTYs to scrape a CLI's `/usage` panel. Identity has no business dragging that
 * graph in: pricing, cost attribution, and route validation all need to answer
 * "which plan is this provider on?" without being able to start a subprocess.
 *
 * Distinct from `lib/providerVendors.js`, which is argv-shaped and includes
 * vendors with no subscription quota to meter (opencode, kimi, cursor).
