// `countWords` was previously re-implemented three times with subtly different
// regexes (`server/services/writersRoom/local.js`, `server/lib/issueLength.js`,
// and the client's `client/src/utils/formatters.js`). They all converge on the
// same intent — count whitespace-delimited tokens — so this is the canonical
// server-side home. The client copy (which cannot import from `server/`) mirrors
// this exact semantics so client and server word counts always agree.

/**
 * Count whitespace-separated words in a string.
 *
 * Non-strings, `null`/`undefined`, and empty/whitespace-only input all return 0.
 * Uses `\S+` matching (equivalent to splitting on `\s+` after a trim) so runs of
 * mixed whitespace — spaces, tabs, newlines — collapse to a single delimiter.
 * Non-string input returns 0 rather than being coerced, so a stray number can't
 * masquerade as a one-word body.
 *
 * @param {unknown} text
 * @returns {number}

 * `no private escapeRegExp` guard in textUtils.test.js scans the server tree and
 * fails the build if a private copy reappears.
 *
 * Non-string input is coerced rather than throwing: the callers escape
 * user-supplied tokens (LoRA trigger words, character aliases, catalog type
 * labels) on the way into `new RegExp(...)`, where a TypeError would surface as
 * an opaque 500 instead of a harmless non-match.

 * transform — `normalizePlannerId`, which slugs a model id into a `planner:`
 * label — could only re-inline the regex chain. Non-string input returns the
