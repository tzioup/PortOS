/**
 * The single per-vendor table behind model refresh.
 *
 * Before this table, adding one vendor to the refresh feature meant four
 * coordinated hand edits: the TUI `else if` chain in `refreshProviderModels`,
 * the CLI `if` chain in `_refreshCLIProviderModels`, the client's
 * `supportsModelRefresh` mirror, and a SECOND transcription of the server
 * dispatch inside the client's parity test. Nothing structurally stopped the
 * next vendor from making three of the four. Now: one row here, and the
 * capability rides to the client on the payload as `canRefreshModels`.
 *
 * ## The columns are the keying conventions
 *
 * Vendors are not identified the same way, and the differences used to live in
 * prose above each branch. They are columns now:
 *
 * - `cliMatch`   — the STRONG identity signal for a `cli` provider: the launch
 *                  command (path/exe-tolerant for vendors whose users configure
 *                  an absolute path), or a structural marker (`ollamaBacked`).
 * - `cliNameMatch` — the WEAK signal: a substring of the user-editable DISPLAY
 *                  NAME. Only consulted once no row has claimed the provider by
 *                  command, so `name: 'Claude via Antigravity'` + `command:
 *                  'claude'` still reaches Anthropic — the right answer for a
 *                  claude binary. A vendor whose word is ordinary English
 *                  (cursor: a DB cursor, a text cursor) deliberately has NO
 *                  name column, or a provider a user named "Cursor Notes" would
 *                  hijack the refresh.
 * - `tuiMatch`   — a `tui` provider's model is normally fixed by its CLI/config,
 *                  so only the vendors whose `--model` flag also applies to the
 *                  interactive session carry this column. It never consults the
 *                  display name: unlike the CLI arm, an EXACT shipped-id match
 *                  is the only non-command signal it admits.
 * - `fetch`      — the provider-service method name that performs the probe.
 *                  Kept as a string so this table stays a pure data module with
 *                  no dependency on the service object it is dispatched from.
 *
 * Adding a vendor is one row. `modelFetchers.test.js` pins that by driving a
 * hypothetical vendor through the table rather than through a chain.
