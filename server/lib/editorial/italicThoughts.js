/**
 * Italicized-internal-thought deterministic primitive (#1300) for the editorial
 * check registry. Pure and dependency-free (no side-effecting imports) so it
 * stays unit-testable in isolation — mirrors ./cliches.js and ./nameSimilarity.js.
 *
 * Backs the deterministic `prose.italic-thoughts` check in checkRegistry.js. The
 * editorial rule: everything on the page is already the POV character's
 * perspective, so setting internal thoughts in *italics* is a tell — a multi-word
 * italic clause is almost always a narrated thought that could simply be prose.
 *
 * High-precision by design (favors under-flagging, like the other deterministic
 * scanners): a SHORT italic span (a stressed word, a title, a foreign term) is
 * emphasis, not a thought, so only runs of `minWords`+ words are flagged. The LLM
 * siblings handle the judgment cases this can't.
