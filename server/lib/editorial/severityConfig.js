/**
 * Editorial severity configuration (#1616) — the frozen DEFAULT severity
 * weights + per-gate blocking-severity sets, plus pure merge/resolve/sanitize
 * helpers that let a SERIES override either one without ever clobbering the
 * defaults when no override is set.
 *
 * This module is PURE (no side-effecting imports). The canonical severity enum
 * is `CHECK_SEVERITIES` (`['high','medium','low']`) re-used from
 * `./checkRegistry.js` so the wire gate, the score weights, and the blocking
 * sets can never drift apart.
 *
 * ABSENT vs INTENTIONALLY-EMPTY is the load-bearing distinction here (mirrors
 * the PortOS LLM-merge rule):
 *
 *  - severity weights: an ABSENT key (override omits high/medium/low, or the
 *    value isn't a finite non-negative number) keeps the frozen default. An
 *    empty `{}` override is "nothing overridden" → all defaults. There is no
 *    "intentionally cleared weight" — a weight is always a number.
 *  - blocking sets: an ABSENT gate (override omits the gate, or its value isn't
 *    an array) falls back to the gate's DEFAULT blocking set. An explicit EMPTY
 *    array (`[]`) is a legitimate, distinct choice — "nothing blocks this gate"
 *    — and is honored as-is (NOT treated as absent). So `Array.isArray` MUST be
 *    checked first, before any emptiness check.
