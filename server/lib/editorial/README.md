# server/lib/editorial — editorial check registry

The backbone of the extensible editorial-review system (#1284, epic #1283): a
declarative registry of "editorial checks" that plug into the series pipeline.
Each check declares its scope, kind, default severity, a Zod config schema, an
optional gate, and a `run(ctx)` that returns findings shaped for the existing
`manuscriptReview` comment store. The runner that builds the shared `ctx`, runs
the enabled checks, and seeds findings lives at
`server/services/pipeline/editorial/checkRunner.js`.

`scope` is a `series | issue | scene | noun` granularity. A check meaningful at
more than one granularity may declare an **array** — `scope: ['series', 'issue']`
(#1628) — instead of being split into two near-duplicate checks; the string form
keeps working. `normalizeCheckScopes` / `primaryCheckScope` (in `checkRegistry.js`)
normalize either form, the load-time guard validates every member, and
`resolveCheckState` exposes both a single primary `scope` (for single-value
consumers) and the full `scopes` array (the catalog and dry-run plan fan a
dual-scope check across each of its declared scopes).

This directory is **pure** (no side-effecting imports — only `zod` and the pure
`estimateTokens` budgeter). LLM-kind checks get their model caller through
`ctx.callStagedLLM` (or `ctx.callInlineLLM` for user-defined checks), and a
manuscript-consuming LLM check plans the corpus into provider-sized chunks
through `ctx.planManuscriptChunks` — all injected by the runner. Per-chunk
findings are merged first-wins (capped at the check's `maxFindings`) via
`editorialFindingKey`, so a long series is fully reviewed regardless of the
provider's context window (#1340).

Checks whose problems span chapters can opt into a **cross-chunk continuity
digest** (#1383): pass `crossChunkDigest: true` to `runManuscriptLlmCheck` and
each chunk after the first is prefixed with `editorialPriorFindingsDigest` of the
findings gathered so far (it rides INSIDE the manuscript var, so no prompt
template change). The digest body is capped (`EDITORIAL_PRIOR_DIGEST_CHARS`) and
**yields to manuscript coverage**: the runner's chunker reports each chunk's
`usableChars` budget, and the digest is prepended only when it fits the chunk's
spare room — so it never displaces manuscript text or overflows the provider
window (a chunk packed to the budget just runs without a digest).
`style.conformance` (tense/POV established earlier),
`objects.unmotivated-interaction` (setup/payoff across chapters), and
`roster.unmodeled-names` (so a later part doesn't re-describe an unmodeled name an
earlier part already surfaced) opt in; `prose.info-dumping` stays per-chunk (its
problems are localized).

A check that re-sends a context block per chunk (the reverse-outline scene map,
character arcs, plotline coverage, style-guide expectations, …) declares it as a
`context: { varName: string }` map on `runManuscriptLlmCheck` rather than baking it
into `overheadTokens`. The runner counts the block as overhead AND, on a small or
fallback context window where a large reverse outline would consume the whole
usable budget and slice the manuscript chunk to `''` (#1459), trims the block to
guarantee the manuscript a budget floor (`MANUSCRIPT_FLOOR_TOKENS`) — the LARGEST
block trimmed first, so the unbounded scene map absorbs the cut while bounded
blocks survive. `buildVars(manuscript, meta, context)` receives the trimmed blocks
as its third arg, so the check feeds the SAME context it was budgeted for. A
plain whole-manuscript scan with no re-sent context keeps the simpler
`overheadTokens` form.

`roster.unmodeled-names` also shows the LLM/deterministic split that keeps a
chunked judgment correct: the model does ONLY what it alone can — surface a proper
noun used as a character name and confirm it's a person (not a place/org/brand/
honorific). A deterministic post-pass in `run()` then counts each surfaced name's
distinct-issue appearances across the WHOLE `ctx.sections` corpus and **authors the
final `location` / `problem` / `suggestion` / severity itself** from that count
(keeping only the model's `anchorQuote` + `issueNumber`). It does NOT append to the
model's free text — owning the frequency narrative outright means a stray model
claim ("appears only once") can't contradict the deterministic verdict. Recurrence
is a whole-corpus count the model can't make per-chunk (a name in issues 1 and 12
looks like a one-off to whichever chunk sees it), so it never trusts the model for
it; a surfaced name the matcher can't find in any section is dropped, not reported.

The findings digest carries prior *problems* forward but not clean prior *setup*
— a payoff in a later chunk can be mis-flagged "missing setup" when the earlier
chunk established it without producing a finding. A check can additionally opt
into a **cross-chunk clean-setup digest** (#1403): pass `crossChunkSetup: true`
(plus a per-check `setupFocus` string) to `runManuscriptLlmCheck`, and after each
non-final chunk one extra inline summarization call (`ctx.callStageScopedInlineLLM`,
tagged `EDITORIAL_SETUP_DIGEST_SOURCE`, built by `buildSetupDigestPrompt`) rolls a
short "setup so far" summary forward. The summary call is **stage-scoped** — it
resolves the same provider/model the check's stage is pinned to (not the active
provider), so manuscript text never routes to a different (e.g. cloud) provider
than the stage chose. The stored summary is capped to `EDITORIAL_SETUP_DIGEST_BODY_CHARS`
so a verbose summarizer response can't compound across chunks. `editorialSetupDigest` wraps it and prepends it to
later chunks alongside the findings digest — also yielding to spare budget, and
fitted *after* the findings digest so manuscript coverage and the findings digest
both win when budget is tight. A single-chunk (whole-fits) run never summarizes,
so it pays nothing. When the reverse-outline (#1349) or continuity-bible (#1305)
artifacts land, either could feed this context more cheaply than a per-chunk call.

## Inter-check context sharing (#1627)

Within a single pass a check can read the findings produced by **other checks it
explicitly depends on**, so compound signals are possible (e.g. on-the-nose
dialogue that is *also* doing exposition for a setup another check flagged). The
sharing is **opt-in and scoped**, which keeps every other check a pure function of
its declared `sources` (order-independent):

- A check declares `dependsOn: ['<otherCheckId>', …]` on its registry entry. The
  runner topologically orders the pass (`orderChecksByDependencies`) so every
  declared dependency runs **before** the dependent — independent checks keep their
  exact registry order, so a pass where nothing opts in is unchanged.
- During its `run(ctx)`, the dependent reads `ctx.priorFindings` — the stamped
  findings (each carrying `checkId`) that its declared dependencies produced earlier
  this pass — or `ctx.findingsByCheck('<id>')` for a single dependency's findings.
  Both are **scoped to declared deps only**: a check that declares no `dependsOn`
  always sees an empty `ctx.priorFindings`, and `findingsByCheck` returns `[]` for
  any id the check didn't declare. The array and each finding are **frozen** — a
  check may read but never mutate another check's already-seeded findings.
- Degrade-tolerant: a dependency that is disabled, outside a targeted subset run, or
  errored this pass simply contributes no findings (the dependent still runs). A
  dependency **cycle** is a registry bug — it's logged and the cycle's members fall
  back to registry order. The dependent must therefore tolerate missing prior
  findings. `dependsOn` shape (string-array, no self-reference) is enforced at load.
- **Staleness is dependency-aware.** Because a dependency-consuming finding can
  change when its *dependency's* source content drifts (not only its own), the
  staleness fingerprint and the per-source I/O gates fold in each check's transitive
  declared-dependency sources (`effectiveCheckSources` in the runner). So a compound
  finding goes stale exactly when any source it transitively depended on changes —
  never falsely fresh, never falsely stale — computed identically at seed-time and
  read-time. A check with no `dependsOn` is fingerprinted on its own `sources` as
  before.

## Discovery rule

Before adding an editorial rule, check whether an existing registry entry covers
it. To add a new built-in check, append an entry to `EDITORIAL_CHECKS` in
`checkRegistry.js` (the fail-fast guards enforce shape, enum, and unique-id).

The interiority family is the worked example of how close two checks can sit
without overlapping — four checks read the same paragraphs and each judges a
different axis, so a new one has to name which axis is still unclaimed:
`interiority.protagonist` (#1294) judges **presence** (are the four POV
dimensions developed at all), `scene.interiority-balance` (#1623) judges
**ratio** (does description swamp inner life inside a scene),
`prose.italic-thoughts` judges **formatting** consistency of rendered thought,
and `interiority.register` (#3593) judges **diction** — whether the thought that
is on the page sounds like that character thinking or like the author writing an
essay, reconciled against how the character speaks. The boundary is enforced in
the prompt bodies (each names the others' territory in its do-NOT-flag list) and
pinned by `checks/proseStyle.test.js`, because nothing in the registry stops
three checks from returning three findings on one paragraph.

Declare every input the check's `run(ctx)` reads in its `sources` array (a
non-empty subset of `EDITORIAL_SOURCES`: `manuscript`, `canon`,
`series.styleGuide`, `series.arc.tickingClock`, `series.arc.readerMap`,
`series.arc.themes`, `reverseOutline`, `reverseOutline.plotlines`,
`editorialArcs`, `series.characterArcs`, `storyboard.shots`, `comicScript`,
`prose`).
The `series.arc.themes` token (#1317) fingerprints the AUTHORED arc themes the
`theme.coherence` check reconciles the prose against (lives on the already-loaded
series record, no extra I/O — adding/editing a declared theme stales its findings).
The staleness
runner fingerprints exactly those sources, so a finding goes stale only when
content the check actually analyzed drifts — declare too few and a finding stays
falsely fresh; a `manuscript` source must pair with `needsManuscript: true`, and
`reverseOutline` makes the runner fetch the cached reverse-outline (#1286) and
inject `ctx.reverseOutline` (the scenes array); `reverseOutline.plotlines` (#1310)
injects `ctx.reverseOutlinePlotlines` (the outline's plotline list) off that same
fetch, so the `plot.structure-momentum` check can reconcile dropped subplots
against the author's tagged threads. `editorialArcs` (#1295) makes the
runner fetch the series editorial aggregate and inject `ctx.editorialArcs` (the
detected per-character `{ name, arcDirection, issueCount, isProtagonist }`
projection — the coarse DETECTED arc signal) plus a derived
`ctx.editorialArcsComplete` boolean (true only when every analyzable issue is
analyzed and fresh), so a check can tell "absent because arc-less" from "absent
because not-yet-analyzed" under a partial coverage batch. `series.characterArcs`
(#1293) reads the AUTHORED per-character arcs off the already-loaded series
record (`series.characterArcs[]` — want/need, start → end state, transition
beats), which the `arc.transitions` check reconciles detected change moments
against. `storyboard.shots` (#1315) is built off the already-loaded issues (no
extra I/O) and injects `ctx.storyboardScenes` (a flat `{ issueNumber, scene }`
list for every issue with storyboard scenes), which the deterministic
`visual.shot-continuity` check reads for 180°-rule axis reversals + shot-type
monotony and the LLM siblings `visual.eyeline-match` (#1466) and
`visual.appearance-continuity` (#1467) read for gaze reciprocity and
appearance/prop continuity respectively. `comicScript` (#1313) fingerprints every issue's AUTHORITATIVE comic content,
keyed by issue number — the edited comic-pages split (`stages.comicPages.pages[]`)
when present, else the generated `stages.comicScript.output` (derived from the
already-loaded `ctx.issues`, no extra fetch). The `comic.lettering-density` check
reads the same content (via the shared `comicLetteringIssues`) to count
balloon/panel/page word load, so a finding stales exactly when the comic text the
check read changes — not when an unrelated image renders. The LLM check
`comic.prose-sync` (#1589) is the CROSS-MEDIA sibling: for a hybrid comic+prose
issue it pairs that issue's **`prose`-stage** text with its comic content
(`comicScript.pacing`) and flags substantive divergences — an unshown beat,
contradicted dialogue, or a chronology disagreement — making one model call per
hybrid issue and fingerprinting both the prose and the comic so a finding stales
when either drifts. It declares the `prose` source (not `manuscript`) on purpose:
the stitched manuscript picks `comicScript` over `prose` for a hybrid issue, so a
`manuscript` source would compare the comic against itself; both halves are read off
the already-loaded `ctx.issues` (the `prose` stage via `proseStageIssues`). When a new check reads a
`ctx.series` field (or another artifact) that isn't yet a token, add the token to
`EDITORIAL_SOURCES` and a matching resolver in the runner's `SOURCE_RESOLVERS`.

## User-defined checks (#1346)

Users author their own LLM checks (name + prompt + scope) from the Editorial
Checks UI — no code change. A custom check's DEFINITION lives in settings
(`pipelineEditorialChecks.customChecks[]`); its enable/config override reuses the
SAME `checks[id]` slice the built-ins use. `buildCustomCheck(def)` synthesizes a
definition into the exact shape the registry/runner consume (an always-
manuscript-consuming LLM check, `id` prefixed `custom.`), so it flows through
`resolveCheckState` / `getEnabledChecks` / the runner identically to a built-in.
The fixed findings-JSON output contract is enforced by `buildCustomCheckPrompt`
(the user only describes WHAT to look for), and the model is called through the
runner-injected `ctx.callInlineLLM` (an inline-prompt sibling of
`ctx.callStagedLLM`, no shipped stage template). CRUD lives at
`POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/pipeline/editorial/custom-checks`.

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `checkRegistry.js` | The public entry point. Assembles `EDITORIAL_CHECKS` by spreading the per-category arrays from `./checks/*.js`, re-exports the shared infra from `./checkInfra.js`, and keeps the registry's lookup/state helpers that need the assembled array: `EDITORIAL_SOURCES` (the per-check `sources` vocabulary the staleness runner fingerprints, #1387), fail-fast guards (`assertValidChecks`), and `getCheck`, `getCheckById`, `getAllChecks`, `listChecks`, `resolveCheckState`, `getEnabledChecks`, `resolveCheckConfig`, `orderChecksByDependencies` (the dependency topo-sort, #1627) plus the user-defined-check helpers (`buildCustomCheck`, `readCustomCheckDefs`, `isCustomCheckId`, `isValidCustomCheckDef`). Decomposed from a 7,474-line god file in #1829. |
| `checkInfra.js` | Shared check infrastructure extracted in #1829: imports + constants + stage names + the pure summary/helper functions (e.g. `runManuscriptLlmCheck`, `canonCharacterTraitsSummary`, `editorialFindingKey`, `buildCustomCheckPrompt`, `normalizeCheckScopes`/`primaryCheckScope`) that the check definitions and the registry tail depend on. Kept side-effect-free so `./checks/*.js` import from it without a cycle through `checkRegistry.js` (whose `EDITORIAL_CHECKS` spread would otherwise hit a TDZ on the checks' eagerly-evaluated `configSchema`s). Re-exports its externals (zod + the sibling primitive modules) so a check file imports everything from one hub. **Since #2842 this file is a pure re-exporting barrel over `./checkInfra/*.js`** (it had grown to 2,635 lines spanning a dozen sub-domains); every existing `from './checkInfra.js'` import still resolves, and new code may import the focused module directly. |
| `checkInfra/*.js` | The sub-domain modules behind the `checkInfra.js` barrel (#2842, same treatment #1152 gave `arcPlanner.js`): `externals` (the zod/`estimateTokens`/sibling-scanner hub), `taxonomy` (scopes/kinds/severities/`EDITORIAL_SOURCES`/field types), `revealForeshadowing`, `craftStages`, `structureStages` (stage names + their prompt summaries), `voiceCanon` (voice/state/trait/continuity-ledger summaries), `povAndNames`, `canonScaffolding` (relationship-link + object-attachment walkers), `llmRunner` (chunked manuscript runs, prior-findings/setup digests, finding normalization, custom-check prompts), `readability`, `rosterCast`, `sceneAnalysis`, `proseDensity`, `comic` (lettering + comic↔prose sync). Import via the barrel or directly; `checkInfraBarrel.test.js` pins the re-export contract. |
| `checks/*.js` | The `EDITORIAL_CHECKS` definitions, grouped by category (#1829): `naming`, `cast`, `pov`, `characterArc`, `continuity` (incl. #2178 `continuity.premature-reveal` — the information-economy guard that flags a reveal-gated canon fact leaked before its reveal issue, reconciled against `revealGatedCanonSummary`; gated on `canonHasRevealGated`), `comic`, `visual`, `scene`, `dialogue`, `proseStyle`, `research`, `slop` (#2165 — `prose.slop-banned-words`/`prose.ai-tells`/`prose.structural-tics`/`prose.burstiness`, built on `../slopScore.js`), `world` (#2175 — `world.unforeshadowed-solution`/`world.cost-free-power`, the review-side companion to the Sanderson's-Laws worldbuilding doctrine injected into the universe-expansion generation prompt; reconciles against canon + the continuity-bible world-rule facts). Each exports a `<group>Checks` array of declarative check entries (scope, kind, severity, `configSchema`, `gate`, `run(ctx)`); `checkRegistry.js` imports and spreads them. Internal to the registry — imported only via `checkRegistry.js`, not the barrel. |
| `nameSimilarity.js` | Pure, dependency-free name-confusability primitives for `naming.dissimilar-names` (#1291): `normalizeName`, `vowelSkeleton`, `soundex` (phonetic key), `levenshtein` (edit distance), `nameSimilaritySignals` (the per-pair signal list, with option toggles), and `firstLetterHistogram` / `findFirstLetterClusters` (cast first-letter crowding). |
| `cliches.js` | Pure, dependency-free cliché + overwriting primitives for `prose.cliches` and `prose.modifier-stacking` (#1308): `CLICHE_PHRASES` (seed stock-simile/idiom list), `findCliches` (whole-word phrase scan with house-style allow/extra lists), and `findModifierStacking` (cumulative no-comma runs of 3+ stacked adjectives/adverbs). The LLM sibling `prose.dead-metaphor` handles the judgment cases (mixed/dead metaphor, novel clichés, purple prose). |
| `italicThoughts.js` | Pure, dependency-free italic-thought primitive for `prose.italic-thoughts` (#1300): `findItalicThoughts` (multi-word markdown `*…*` / `_…_` italic runs, dedup + word-count threshold so single-word emphasis, bold, and `snake_case` are skipped). The LLM siblings (`opening.wrong-start`, `prose.mirror-description`, `dialogue.pleasantries`, `prose.kill-your-darlings`) handle the judgment cases in the #1300 anti-pattern bundle. |
| `proseTics.js` | Pure, dependency-free copy-edit prose-tic primitives for the #1306 line-edit group: `tokenizeWords` / `splitSentences` (the ONE prose-word tokenizer — `tokenizeWords(text).length` is the letter-word count every density rate, rhythm metric and slop score shares, distinct on purpose from `lib/textUtils.js#countWords`; `proseTics.test.js` fails the suite when the character class is re-spelled elsewhere under server/), `findFilterWords` (`prose.filter-words`), `findHedgeWords` (`prose.hedge-words` — hedge/weasel distance markers: metaphorical distance, dialogue hedges, cognitive weasel words), `findCrutchWords` (`prose.crutch-words`), `findAdverbs` (`prose.adverbs` — `-ly` adverbs + dialogue-tag adverbs), `findPassiveVoice` (`prose.passive-voice` — be-verb + past-participle heuristic; classifies each hit `weak`/`stative`/`mood` + `byAgent` so #1593 context tuning can suppress intentional passive) and its `filterPassiveVoice` companion (drops `stative` predicate-adjectives + `mood` setting images unless `suppressIntentional` is off), `findGestures` (`prose.repeated-gestures` — gesture tally + body-part autonomy), plus the seed `FILTER_WORDS` / `HEDGE_WORDS` / `CRUTCH_WORDS` / `GESTURE_WORDS` lists. The LLM sibling `prose.telling-emotion` handles the named-emotion judgment case. |
| `repetition.js` | Pure, dependency-free word-echo & rhythm primitives for #1306: `findWordEchoes` (`prose.word-echoes` — distinctive word repeated within a window), `findRepeatedOpeners` (runs of sentences sharing an opener, "He… He… He…"), and `measureSentenceRhythm` (`prose.sentence-rhythm` — sentence-length variation). Reuses `tokenizeWords` / `splitSentences` from `proseTics.js`. |
| `slopScore.js` | Pure, dependency-free deterministic "AI slop" scoring primitives for #2165 (CWQE Phase 1) — EXTENDS proseTics.js/cliches.js/repetition.js rather than duplicating them: tiered banned-word scanners (`findBannedWordsTier1` hard-ban, `findSuspiciousWordClusters` Tier 2 cluster-of-3+) backing `prose.slop-banned-words`; fiction AI-tell idiom regexes (`findAiTells`) backing `prose.ai-tells`; rhetorical structural-tic detectors (`findNotJustButPatterns`, `findNotSayingPatterns`, `findNegativeAssertions`, `findTheWaySimiles`, `findTriadicShortSentences`, combined by `findStructuralTics`) backing `prose.structural-tics`; and quantitative burstiness signals (`emDashDensityPer1000`, `transitionOpenerRatio`, `paragraphLengthUniformity`, `countSectionBreaks`) backing `prose.burstiness`. `computeSlopPenalty()` composites all of the above — plus `repetition.js`'s sentence-length CV, read but never re-reported as its own finding — into a documented-weight 0–10 penalty for Phase 3's `qualityScore = judgeOverall − slopPenalty`. |
| `voiceFingerprint.js` | Pure, dependency-free statistical voice-fingerprint primitives for the deterministic `style.voice-drift` check (#2166 — CWQE Phase 2), the cheap sibling of the LLM `style.voice-consistency`. Reuses `tokenizeWords`/`splitSentences` (proseTics.js) + `splitParagraphs`/`emDashDensityPer1000` (slopScore.js) rather than re-implementing them. `computeFingerprint(text)` measures one issue's metric vector (sentence mean/σ/CV, fragment %, long-sentence %, paragraph mean/σ, dialogue ratio, em-dash rate, abstract-noun & simile density per 1k, dominant sentence-opener %, plus optional `well:*` vocabulary coverage); `splitManuscriptByIssue` / `voiceFingerprintMatrix` fingerprint every `# Issue N` section; `computeVoiceDrift` computes series mean/σ per metric and flags issues > threshold·σ out (small-N gated below `minIssues`), and — under an exemplar/blended baseline (#2248) — emits a `seriesFindings[]` of series-level "the whole corpus is uniformly off the chosen voice" mismatches for metrics whose drafted σ≈0 but whose shared value sits a scale-free relative distance from the chosen-voice center; `parseVoiceWells` parses the `name: word, word; …` config spec; `describeDrift` renders a per-issue finding sentence and `describeSeriesDrift` the series-level one; `renderFingerprintTable` renders the issues×metrics matrix (outliers marked); `describeMetricColumn(key)` / `metricUnit(key)` give the self-describing column header (label/unit/higher/lower/isWell) shared by the finding text and the deep-linkable matrix view (#2194). `VOICE_METRICS` is the static metric descriptor list. |
| `comicPacing.js` | Pure, dependency-free comic-pacing primitives for the #1314 comic-pacing group: `isSplashPage`, `comicSpreadLayout` (recto/verso + spread + `beginsSpread` page-turn map), `summarizeComicPages`, `analyzePanelRhythm` (`comic.panel-rhythm` — splash overuse / back-to-back splashes / overcrowded pages / grid monotony), `comicPageTurnSummary` + `authoredRevealSummary` (LLM-context renderers for `comic.page-turn-beats`). Operates on already-parsed comic pages (the runner parses each issue's stored comic script and injects them as the `comicScript` source) so the editorial dir stays import-pure. |
| `shotContinuity.js` | Pure, dependency-free storyboard shot-continuity primitives for the deterministic `visual.shot-continuity` check (#1315): `findAxisReversals` (180°-rule axis flips across a continuity-linked shot pair using `screenDirection`) and `findShotTypeMonotony` (a scene whose classified shots all share one `shotType`). Also `summarizeStoryboardShots` (#1466) — renders the collected `{ issueNumber, scene }` storyboard list into a compact per-scene shot block shared by the LLM siblings `visual.eyeline-match` (gaze reciprocity / eyeline-vs-screen-direction) and `visual.appearance-continuity` (#1467 — diffs the same entity's wardrobe/prop/setting descriptions across shots for contradictions). Reads the shot-grammar fields from `server/lib/shotGrammar.js`. |
| `dialogue.js` | Pure, dependency-free dialogue-tag primitives for the #1307 dialogue-craft group: `findSaidBookisms` (`dialogue.said-bookisms` — ornate speech tags like *expostulated*/*opined* and non-speech tags like "she smiled", matched only when adjacent to a double-quote span) and `findUnattributedDialogueRuns` (`dialogue.attribution-clarity` — runs of consecutive untagged/unbeated dialogue lines where the speaker can't be tracked), plus `attributeDialogueByOwner` (the coarse per-character dialogue-line tally behind `cast.representation-balance`'s dialogue-share signal, #1312 — credits each quoted paragraph to the first owner named in its beat) and the seed `SAID_BOOKISMS` / `NON_SPEECH_TAGS` lists. Also `inventoryDialogueTags` + `splitScenes` + `findDialogueTagVariety` (`dialogue.tag-variety`, #1587 — per-scene tag inventory flagging within-scene **monotony** (one verb dominates) and **over-variation** (a fresh verb on nearly every line); collapses inflections onto a base lemma via `PLAIN_SPEECH_TAG_GROUPS`). The LLM siblings `dialogue.on-the-nose` (subtext-free / "as you know, Bob" dialogue), `dialogue.voice-distinctiveness` (per-character voice against canon `speechPattern`/`speechAccent`) and `dialogue.reported-speech` (#3592 — a decisive utterance narrated as reported speech instead of quoted, which no quote-delimited scan can see because there is no quote on the page) handle the judgment cases. |
| `letteringDensity.js` | Pure, dependency-free comic lettering-density primitives for `comic.lettering-density` (#1313): `panelLetteringMetrics` (per-panel balloon/caption/SFX word + balloon tally over the `comicScriptParser` output), `analyzeComicLettering` (flags balloons/panels/pages over the configurable thresholds in `DEFAULT_LETTERING_THRESHOLDS`), `overflowSeverity` (severity scaled by how far over the limit), and `sanitizeLetteringThresholds`. Word counts come from `lib/textUtils.js#countWords` (the whitespace count readers see, not the letter-word tokenizer the prose checks share); `client/src/lib/letteringDensity.js` re-exports this module for the comic-script stage's inline warnings. |
| `balloonAttribution.js` | Pure, dependency-free comic speech-balloon attribution primitives for `comic.balloon-attribution`: `analyzeBalloonAttribution` (flags a dialogue line whose speaker isn't shown in the panel description and carries no off-panel/broadcast cue — the case the image model mis-attributes to a visible character), `splitSpeaker`, `nameInText`, and `OFFPANEL_OK_MODIFIER` (the broadcast/off-panel/V.O./transmission modifier vocabulary — mirrors `visualStages.js` `BALLOON_STYLE_HINTS`, keep in sync). Severity scales `medium`/`low` by whether another canon character is visibly named in the panel. |
| `panelDisagreement.js` | Pure reader-panel disagreement-mining primitives for the four-persona reader panel (#2170 — CWQE Phase 6): the `PANEL_PERSONAS` / `PANEL_QUESTIONS` vocabulary, `sanitizePersonaResponse` (one persona's raw LLM answer → stable `{ persona, answers:{<qid>:{text,issues[]}}, verdict }` shape), `minePanelDisagreements` (cross-persona `consensus` ≥3-persona concern citations / `attention` some-but-not-all / `polarizing` best-vs-worst-scene splits), and `consensusToFindings` (consensus entries → `seedReviewFromFindings` finding shapes). Pure — all I/O (digest build, per-persona LLM calls, snapshot storage, review seeding) lives in `server/services/pipeline/readerPanel.js`. |
| `cutApplier.js` | Pure, dependency-free adversarial-cut matcher/applier shared by the pipeline manuscript applier (`server/services/pipeline/applyCuts.js`) and the Writers Room polish loop (#2173): `locateCutSpan` (exact → whitespace-normalized regex → refuse ambiguous/short), `planCutsForSection` (safe-type filter + overlap guard → `{ applicable, refused }`), `applyCutsToText` (reverse-order span removal), `collapseBlankLines`, `buildWhitespaceTolerantRegex`, and `MIN_ANCHOR_CHARS`. Re-exports `CUT_TYPES`/`SAFE_CUT_TYPES` from `checkInfra.js`. Extracted from `applyCuts.js` so a freeform work body and per-issue stage sections share one matcher without coupling Writers Room to the pipeline. |
| `severityConfig.js` | Pure per-series severity-config helpers (#1616): the frozen `DEFAULT_SEVERITY_WEIGHTS` (high:12/medium:5/low:1) + `DEFAULT_BLOCKING_SEVERITIES` per autopilot gate (`BLOCKING_GATES` = arc/beatContinuity/editorial), `mergeSeverityWeights` (merge a per-series weight override over the defaults — absent/invalid keys keep the default), `resolveBlockingSet` (the per-gate blocking `Set` — `Array.isArray` first so an explicit empty `[]` "nothing blocks" is distinct from an absent gate's default), and the wire bounders `sanitizeSeverityWeights` / `sanitizeBlockingSeverities` (persisted on the series record, gated at `pipelineSeries` v9). Reuses `CHECK_SEVERITIES` from `checkRegistry.js` as the canonical enum so the wire gate can't drift. |
| `index.js` | Barrel re-export of the above. |
