/**
 * Browser-extension error detection.
 *
 * Content scripts injected by extensions (wallets, password managers, ad
 * blockers) run in the page's realm, so anything they throw surfaces through
 * OUR `window.onerror` / `unhandledrejection` handlers and lands in the Review
 * Hub as an actionable alert. Those errors are not in the app's control and
 * are not actionable — a user cannot fix MetaMask by changing PortOS.
 *
 * Beyond noise, they actively displace real errors: both the client reporter
 * and the server aggregator gate on a 1/sec throttle, so an extension error
 * accepted at T causes a genuine PortOS error at T+500ms to be dropped as
 * `rate-limited` and lost. That is why both ends check this BEFORE their
 * throttle gate rather than filtering at the Review Hub on read.
 *
 * Detection is provenance-first: an extension URL scheme in the script source
 * or the stack is proof the frame is not ours, and that covers every case
 * observed in practice. Message matching only backstops stackless rejections
 * (`reject('Failed to connect to MetaMask')` carries no frames at all); see
 * EXTENSION_MESSAGE_RE below for the bar a new pattern has to clear.
 *
 * A pure leaf: client/src/lib/extensionErrors.js re-exports it, so it must
 * import no Node built-in and nothing outside `server/lib`.

// URL schemes an injected content script can run from. Provenance beats

// would alternate true/false across calls.

// provenance has nothing to match on. Every entry is a permanent, silent
// drop rule, so the bar is deliberately high — add one only when:
//   1. an actual observed error escaped the provenance check above, AND
//   2. the string is absent from our own source (grep before adding).
// The failure modes are asymmetric: an extension error we miss is mild noise
// the user can dismiss, while an over-broad pattern hides a real bug forever.
// When in doubt, leave it out and let provenance do the work.
