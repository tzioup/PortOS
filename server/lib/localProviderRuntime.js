/**
 * Which local runtime a provider talks to, and at which endpoint.
 *
 * A provider like `opencode-llama-tui` is only half a configuration: PortOS can
 * spawn the OpenCode CLI perfectly and the run still dies with "Cannot connect
 * to API: Unable to connect" because the daemon it points at — `llama-server`,
 * the Ollama daemon, LM Studio's server, an MTPLX process, a vLLM container —
 * was never installed
 * or never started. The binary check in `providerRuntimeInstaller.js` answers
 * "can PortOS run `opencode`?", which is a different question and stays green in
 * exactly that failure.
 *
 * This module is the pure half of the answer: given a provider record, which
 * local runtime backs it (`llama` / `ollama` / `lmstudio` / `mtplx` / `vllm` /
 * `sglang` / `slotstream`) and what
 * base URL should be probed. `services/providerReadiness.js` does the probing.
 * Kept side-effect-free so both the readiness service and its tests can reason
 * about the mapping without a daemon on the host.
 *
 * `localBackendForProvider` (and the loopback-host rules under it) lived in
 * `services/localModelHealing.js` until this module existed; it moved here so
 * the healing path and the readiness path classify a provider identically, and
 * `localModelHealing.js` re-exports it for its existing callers.
 *
 * Endpoint resolution deliberately prefers the provider's OWN configuration
 * over any default: a user who moved llama-server to another port edited
 * `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` (or `endpoint`), and probing the old default anyway would
 * report their working setup as broken.
