/**
 * The URL prefixes the SERVER owns, as data — deliberately a leaf module with
 * zero imports, so anything (a Vite config, a drift guard, a build script) can
 * read it without dragging express or a service into its graph.
 *
 * Two lists, for two different jobs:
 *
 *   - `ASSET_ROUTE_PREFIXES` is every `/data/**` static mount. Under
 *     `npm run dev` the browser talks to Vite on :5554, and an UNPROXIED path
 *     does not 404 — Vite's SPA fallback answers it with index.html and a 200,
 *     so a binary loader parses HTML and fails far from the cause. The dev
 *     proxy covers the namespace with one `'^/data/'` wildcard rather than a
 *     list that can fall behind; this is what
 *     `scripts/dev-proxy-drift.test.js` checks that wildcard against, mount by
 *     mount, so a future mount added OUTSIDE `/data/` still fails loudly.
 *
 *   - `SERVER_OWNED_PREFIXES` is what must never reach the SPA fallback in
 *     PRODUCTION. That fallback skips a request only when its path carries a
 *     file extension (`/\.\w+$/`), which held only because every asset happened
 *     to have one: an extensionless `/data/image-to-3d/<id>/model` fell through
 *     to the stamped index.html with a 200 — the same HTML-instead-of-bytes
 *     failure as the dev-proxy hole, on the other side of the deployment
 *     (#4688). `/api` and `/sdapi` have the identical hole for a mistyped path,
 *     where the symptom is worse: a client asking for JSON gets HTML and a 200.
 *
 * Keeping the two beside each other is the point: a new server namespace is
 * one edit, not two half-remembered ones.
