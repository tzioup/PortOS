/**
 * Hand-authored model aliases for one provider route (#6369).
 *
 * A route's `modelMap` answers one question: what does THIS harness have to be
 * sent for a given canonical backend model. `resolveRouteModels` derives it by
 * round-tripping every stored model string through the harness's own adapter,
 * and a string no candidate reproduces is reported rather than rewritten — an
 * OpenCode route carrying a bare `example-model` where the harness needs
 * `<namespace>/example-model` resolves to nothing at all. Nothing then puts
 * that model into the shared catalog, so no harness model menu can offer it.
 *
 * This module is the correction: the user names the pair by hand, and it wins.
 *
 * **The merge rule.** Observed and overridden aliases are stored separately and
 * merged on read, never merged on write:
 *
 *   - `model_map` is what the last refresh OBSERVED, rewritten wholesale by
 *     each refresh. A model the backend dropped leaves it, as it should.
 *   - `model_alias_overrides` is what the USER wrote. No refresh reads or
 *     writes it; only an explicit edit adds or removes an entry.
 *   - The effective map is `{ ...observed, ...overrides }`, so an override wins
 *     a key collision and survives every subsequent refresh.
 *
 * An override for a model the route no longer lists is kept and reported
 * stale — the same rule the model pins and a binding's narrowed subset already
 * follow, because silently dropping a saved value is how a human's choice
 * disappears with nobody deciding to remove it.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no clock, no provider call.
