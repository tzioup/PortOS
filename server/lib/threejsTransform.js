 * Affine transform primitives shared by every server-side gate that has to

 * `threejsModel.js` (flatness), `threejsModelPenetration.js` (cross-part
 * overlap) and `threejsModelPhysicalAudit.js` (bounds and pose) each used to
 * carry their own row-major 3x3 copy of this math. They were algebraically
 * identical but textually different, so nothing stopped the three gates from
 * silently starting to measure three different scenes — and they had already
 * drifted on input hardening, which is why the coercion below is part of the
 * contract rather than a caller's problem.
 *
 * Matrices are row-major 3x3 flat arrays; a transform is `{ linear, translation }`.
 * The rotation composition matches `THREE.Euler` order 'XYZ' — what the preview
 * canvas and the exported factory both apply. A different composition here would
 * measure a part that is not the one on screen.
