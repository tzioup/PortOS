/**
 * Read-only view of the user's own `~/.codex/config.toml` model routing.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Third-party bridges re-point the Codex CLI by writing
 * top-level routing keys — a base URL, a named model provider, a model catalog
 * — into that file. Every `codex` invocation on the machine then runs through
 * whatever the file names, PortOS's own spawns included, while the AI Providers
 * card keeps reporting the signed-in ChatGPT account's readiness and the quota
 * meters keep reporting that account's limits. Nothing is wrong with choosing
 * such a bridge; the failure is that PortOS reports one thing and does another.
 * This module is what lets it say so.
 *
 * READ ONLY, ALWAYS. Never write, repair, or migrate this file — it is the
 * user's, several tools edit it, and a rewrite by PortOS can silently unpick
 * somebody else's install. Detection is a read and a report, never a fix and
 * never a fail-closed prerequisite.
 *
 * MACHINE-LOCAL. `baseUrl` can embed a host name or a port, so it is the
 * user's private data (root AGENTS.md, Sensitive Data & Privacy): render it in
 * the local UI, never log it, never persist it, and never let it cross
 * federation.
 *
 * A few anchored line matches, deliberately not a TOML parser: the question is
 * only whether one of three well-known keys is assigned at the TOP level, and a
 * dependency to answer it would be a poor trade.
