/**
 * Guard for the pre-install zone: the CI `Plan test impact` job checks out the
 * repo and immediately runs `node scripts/ci-base-sha.js` and
 * `node scripts/ci-test-plan.js` — with no `npm ci` before them. Those two
 * scripts, and everything they transitively import, therefore have to load
 * from a bare checkout, using Node builtins only.
 *
 * Nothing enforces that today, and the failure is invisible until it isn't:
 * `server/lib/` is one `import { z } from 'zod'` away from unloadable (its
 * barrel already is), so "just move the shared helper somewhere tidier" would
 * take out the first job in CI — the one that decides what every other job
 * runs. That makes it latent rather than live, which is exactly why it needs a
 * guard rather than a comment.
 *
 * This is also why scripts/lib/directInvocation.js stays in scripts/lib/
 * rather than moving to server/lib/ alongside the other pure helpers: it is
 * imported by both pre-install entrypoints.
