"""
Shared helpers for the PortOS local image-gen Python runners
(`flux2_macos.py` and `z_image_turbo.py`).

Both runners present the same CLI surface to `server/services/imageGen/local.js`
— STAGE: markers, USER_ERROR: lines, stepwise PNG previews, sidecar JSON — and
the bits that own that contract live here. Keeping these in one module means a
fix to the HF error mapping or the stepwise decode lands in both runners at
once, instead of drifting.

The runner-specific bits each script still owns:
  - argparse + which pipeline class / weight repo to load
  - `load_pipeline_*` (sdnq / int8 / auto-pipeline / ERNIE)
  - the txt2img-vs-i2i pipe swap (`to_i2i_pipeline` in z-image)

Anything generic — device picking, RNG seeding, memory-saving knobs, sidecar
writes, stepwise preview decode, USER_ERROR markers, and the cause-chain
walker that turns a buried `GatedRepoError` into a friendly link — belongs here.

    OOM-ing, and every denoising step thrashes across PCIe — ~50x slower than
    the GPU is capable of. When the weights plus an activation reserve won't
    fit in free VRAM, fall back to `enable_model_cpu_offload()`: the
    transformer stays resident across the loop while the text encoder and VAE
    are paged in only for their one-shot forward, so peak VRAM drops well
    under the card's limit and the steps run at full GPU speed.

    MPS / CPU keep the plain `.to(device)` path — offload is a CUDA+accelerate
    feature and the sysmem-fallback failure mode it guards against is
    CUDA-specific. Override the heuristic with `PORTOS_IMAGE_OFFLOAD=1`
    (force offload) or `PORTOS_IMAGE_OFFLOAD=0` (force full residency).
    Returns the effective placement string for logging.
