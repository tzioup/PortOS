/**
 * Make render identity part of the pre-arc character foundation.
 *
 * The character architect previously completed the psychological engine while
 * its response contract omitted physicalDescription and every visual-design
 * field. Graphic-novel series could therefore settle their plots around a cast
 * whose bodies, silhouettes, and palettes were still blank. The judge now
 * treats that as an incomplete character foundation and the repair stage owns
 * those fields. Hash replacement preserves customized prompts and is
 * idempotent.
