/**
 * Update the `cd-plan` stage prompt to document cross-step RESULT REFERENCES
 * (`{{steps.<stepId>.result.<key>}}`) so the Creative Director planner can thread
 * a just-minted id into a later step's args.
 *
 * Background (#2773): the CD plan executor dispatches each step's pre-authored
 * `args` verbatim and never interpolated a prior step's output. A `series`
 * commission therefore could only ever create an EMPTY series — the planner had
 * no way to reference the id `pipeline_createSeries` mints when handing it to
 * `pipeline_startSeriesAutopilot`. The executor now resolves
 * `{{steps.<stepId>.result.<key>}}` references at dispatch time
 * (server/services/creativeDirector/planAdvance.js#resolvePlanStepArgs); this
 * prompt change teaches the planner the syntax so it actually emits them.
 *
 * Strategy: hash-driven prompt-replace via `./_lib.js`. Idempotent — only an
 * install still carrying the pre-change (post-193) shipped template is
 * auto-updated; a customized copy is left alone with a merge hint.
