/**
 * CWQE Phase 15 — multi-concept series ideation (#2180).
 *
 * `pipeline-series-generate.md` changed from inventing ONE series concept to
 * inventing SEVERAL genuinely distinct candidate concepts (each with craft
 * facets: hook / world / conflict engine / cost / tension / theme) under an
 * anti-generic banlist, returning a `{candidates:[...]}` JSON payload. The New
 * Series form presents the candidates for user pick; autonomous invention
 * judge-picks the winner via the new `pipeline-series-concept-judge` stage
 * (seeded by the sibling migration 180).
 *
 * `scripts/setup-data.js` only copies *missing* prompt files, so existing
 * installs keep their old single-concept `pipeline-series-generate.md` until
 * this migration rewrites it — and the service's `content.candidates` gate would
 * throw "no usable series concepts" against the old template's single-object
 * output. This hash-driven replace upgrades only installs whose copy still
 * hashes to the prior shipped version; customized prompts are left intact and
 * warned about.
 *
 * Strategy: hash-driven prompt-replace via `./_lib.js`. Idempotent.
