/**
 * CWQE Phase 10 (remainder) — character framework generation doctrine (#2175).
 *
 * `universe-character-expand.md` gained the Ghost → Wound → Lie → Want → Need
 * chain (with interlock checks), the declared arc type, the Three Sliders
 * (proactivity/likability/competence 1–10), and a secrets list — so the
 * character-generation LLM elicits these authored fields up front, which the
 * `arc.*` / `character.consistency` editorial checks then reconcile against
 * (plan vs delivery) instead of inferring both.
 *
 * `scripts/setup-data.js` only copies *missing* prompt files, so existing
 * installs keep their old template until this migration rewrites it. This is a
 * NEW migration slot that OWNS the current shipped hash going forward; migration
 * 027 (the prior owner of universe-character-expand.md) is resynced in this same
 * change per the drift-cross-sync convention: its previous current hash moved
 * into `ACCEPTED_OLD_MD5` and its `NEW_SHIPPED_MD5` was bumped to the post-171
 * hash so its drift-catch test stays in lock-step with the live sample. The
 * drift baseline in `setup-data-drift.test.js` was updated to match.
 *
 * Customization-safe: only installs whose copy still hashes to the prior shipped
 * version are auto-updated; customized prompts are left intact and warned about.
 *
 * Strategy: hash-driven prompt-replace via `./_lib.js`. Idempotent.
