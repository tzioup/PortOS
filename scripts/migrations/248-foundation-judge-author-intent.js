/**
 * Make the protected Universe Builder starter idea part of foundation quality.
 *
 * The judge previously saw only generated world fields. It could therefore
 * approve a coherent replacement premise that contradicted the user's
 * originating concept, then cache that verdict because starterPrompt was not
 * in the input hash. The service now renders and hashes starterPrompt; this
 * prompt change tells the independent judge how to treat that evidence.
 * Hash replacement preserves customized prompts and is idempotent.
