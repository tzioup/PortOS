/**
 * Ship the Cerebras API provider to existing installs.
 *
 * Background: issue-2701. Cerebras exposes an OpenAI-compatible chat API
 * (https://api.cerebras.ai/v1) authenticated with a plain API key, so the
 * toolkit's generic `executeApiRun` drives it with no runner changes — the
 * provider is pure configuration. `api.cerebras.ai` is allowlisted in
 * aiToolkit/endpointGuard.js so the key may be attached outbound.
 *
 * `setup-data.js` merges *missing* provider entries from data.reference, but
 * only when an install re-runs setup. This migration delivers the provider on a
 * plain server restart too, and is the canonical path for deployed installs to
 * pick it up. Purely additive: a brand-new id, so there's no rename or
 * pinned-id rewrite — an existing `cerebras` key is left untouched (idempotent),
 * which also preserves a user's stored apiKey and refreshed model list.
 *
 * Seeded with only `gpt-oss-120b`: as of 2026-07-16 it is Cerebras's sole
 * *production* model — the rest of the catalog (`zai-glm-4.7`, `gemma-4-31b`)
 * is flagged preview and documented as removable "on short notice", so pinning
 * a preview id into a shipped seed would strand installs on a dead model. All
 * four tiers therefore point at the one production model (same shape as the
 * grok-cli/grok-tui single-model entries); "Refresh models" repopulates the
 * live list from GET /v1/models once the user adds a key. `enabled: false`
 * keeps the provider inert until then (no cold-bootstrap LLM calls).
 *
 * Kept in lockstep with data.reference/providers.json and
 * server/lib/aiToolkit/defaults/providers.sample.json. Frozen here as the
 * historical record this migration installs; later default changes ride their
 * own migrations rather than mutating this one.
