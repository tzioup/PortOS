/**
 * Teach the two Writers Room character-facing prompts the narrative framework
 * the bible has always been able to store (#6417):
 *
 * - `writers-room-characters.md` may now PROPOSE motivations / Ghost / Wound /
 *   Lie / Need / Want / arc type / secrets, under an explicit rule that an
 *   empty framework field beats an invented backstory and that an inferred
 *   read is flagged in `missingFromProse`.
 * - `writers-room-evaluate.md` receives the authored framework (when the work
 *   has one) so the editorial pass reports delivery against the writer's plan
 *   instead of inferring the plan and the delivery from the same prose.
