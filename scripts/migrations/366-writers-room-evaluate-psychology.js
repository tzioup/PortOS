/**
 * Name the psychology profile and the Three Sliders in the Writers Room
 * evaluate prompt (#6417).
 *
 * `pickCharacterFramework` began projecting `psychology` and `sliders` into the
 * author-side review payload, but the template's prose still enumerated only
 * the Ghost → Wound → Lie → Need → Want chain — so a reader following the
 * instructions had no idea what the extra JSON keys were, and no ruling on how
 * to read them. This adds that sentence plus the one rule the projection makes
 * necessary: an absent field was left blank on purpose, and a `psychology`
 * ruled `unknown` / `not-applicable` is an authoring decision rather than a gap
 * to report as a defect.
 *
 * Copy-only — no variables changed, so an install still on the previous shipped
 * template keeps working either way; this just stops the prose from describing
 * half the payload.
