/**
 * Update the `cd-plan` stage prompt to document the project's LOCKED render
 * settings (aspect ratio / dimensions / quality / target duration).
 *
 * Background: the Creative Director planner authors `media_enqueueVideoJob`
 * steps freehand. It historically guessed an `aspectRatio` string the video
 * worker doesn't even read (`generateVideo` consumes `width`/`height`, not
 * `aspectRatio`), so a commission locked to 9:16 rendered at the worker's
 * default 768×512 box. The server now forces the locked geometry onto every
 * render (server/services/creative/tools/media.js#enforceVideoRenderPreset);
 * this prompt change tells the planner to stop supplying those params so the
 * plan preview stays honest and the LLM doesn't fight the enforcement.
 *
 * Strategy: hash-driven prompt-replace via `./_lib.js`. Idempotent — only an
 * install still carrying the pre-change shipped template is auto-updated; a
 * customized copy is left alone with a merge hint.
