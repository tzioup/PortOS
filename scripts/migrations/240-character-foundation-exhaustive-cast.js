/**
 * Upgrade the character-foundation prompt from a single implicit core-cast
 * array to an explicit target batch plus the full series ensemble map.
 *
 * The server now processes every story-referenced character in sequential
 * batches. Existing installs need this prompt wording so the model authors the
 * whole target batch while using the full roster for differentiation. The
 * hash-driven replacement preserves customized prompts and is idempotent.
