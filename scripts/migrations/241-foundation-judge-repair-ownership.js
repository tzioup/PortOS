/**
 * Teach the foundation judge which persisted surface owns each repair.

 * A judge could correctly spot a plot synopsis violating a clear world rule,
 * but label it worldbuilding and ask that repair to revise the episode. The
 * world editor can only update the universe bible, so the causal contradiction
 * survived every round. The ownership contract routes plot applications to
 * structure while keeping missing rules in worldbuilding. Hash replacement
 * preserves customized prompts and is idempotent.
