/**
 * Heal cd-treatment.md installs that #1808's migration 148 left stranded (#2042).
 *
 * Migration 148 backfilled the catalog-cast surfacing into
 * `data/prompts/stages/cd-treatment.md` with two ANCHOR-based surgical inserts:
 *   1. the `## Cast & ingredients` list section (anchored on the style-spec →
 *      user-story bracket), and
 *   2. the per-scene `"cast": [{ "ingredientId": … }]` JSON field (anchored on
 *      the scene example's `"imageStrength": null` line).
 *
 * An install seeded BEFORE the `imageStrength` scene knob shipped (the older
 * pre-#1808 template, md5 `2ffa482e…`) carries a scene example that lacks that
 * anchor, so 148 applied insertion 1 (the file gained the cast list) but silently
 * skipped insertion 2 — leaving the file at md5 `95b76856…`: it has the Cast
 * section but is missing the per-scene `cast` field that
 * `data.reference/prompts/stages/cd-treatment.md` ships. Because 148 is already
 * recorded in `data/migrations.applied.json` on those installs, it never re-runs,
 * so the `creativeDirectorPrompts.test.js` cast-threading regression stays red on
 * the runtime template forever.
 *
 * This migration finishes the job with the canonical hash-driven prompt-replace
 * (`./_lib.js`): when the installed copy still matches a KNOWN machine-produced
 * shape (either pristine pre-#1808 shipped version, or the 148-partial strand) it
 * is replaced wholesale with the current shipped reference. A hand-customized
 * copy (hash matches neither old nor new) is left untouched with a warning — same
 * safety contract as every other prompt-replace migration. Idempotent.
 *
 * Exporting ACCEPTED_OLD_MD5 / NEW_SHIPPED_MD5 also folds cd-treatment.md into
 * `buildPromptDriftTables`, so setup-data.js's drift warning classifies a
 * stranded copy as auto-updatable (was previously invisible to the sweep because
 * 148 tracked the file via anchors, not hashes).
