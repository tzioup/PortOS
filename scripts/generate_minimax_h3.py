"""Cache-only PortOS runner for the pinned MiniMax H3 MLX runtime.

The Video Gen UI owns every network operation. This helper resolves only the
exact revisions already present in Hugging Face's cache, loads PipeNetwork's
pinned source checkout, emits PortOS progress/runtime frames, and writes one
joint video-and-audio MP4.

Conditioning is H3's own `fl2va` keyframe path: zero images is text-to-video,
one `--image first` is image-to-video, and a `first` + `last` pair is FFLF.
Each `--image` needs its own `--anchor`, in the same order.

Prompt embeddings: the Qwen3-VL conditioning pass is deterministic in the
prompt, the keyframes and the conditioner, so `--prompt-embedding-cache-dir`
lets a re-render of the same request reuse it. Entries are keyed on the prompt
plus the CONTENT digest of each conditioning image, held under a byte ceiling
with least-recently-used eviction, and every failure — a corrupt entry, an
unwritable directory — falls back to recomputing rather than to a failed
render.

Memory: unified memory means this render and the rest of the machine draw on one
pool. PortOS passes the host floor its declared placement profile needs
(`--min-system-memory-gb`) and the reserve it holds back for the operating
system (`--memory-headroom-gb`); `enforce_system_memory` refuses a box below the
floor before any weight is read (against TOTAL RAM — the reserve is not netted
off first), and `apply_memory_limit` caps MLX's allocator at the rest so a
render that overruns fails as a job instead of wedging the machine.
