/**
 * Coverage guard for repo-scanning guards (issue #5055).
 *
 * A handful of tests assert over the *tracked tree* rather than over anything
 * they import: they shell out to `git grep` / `git ls-files`, read the matched
 * files as text, and fail when some unrelated file anywhere in the repo breaks
 * a convention. `scripts/agent-instructions-files.test.js` is the archetype.
 *
 * CI selects tests by impact (`scripts/ci-test-plan.js`) through Vitest's
 * changed-source import graph or feature-path matching. Neither can reach a
 * scanner: the file that violates the convention
 * is never imported by the guard, so no edge exists to follow. The consequence
 * is not a flaky selection, it is a structural one — a scanner can sit red on
 * `main` indefinitely while every PR reports green, which is exactly what
 * happened to the agent-instructions guard.
 *
 * `ALWAYS_RUN_TESTS` is the only mechanism that can reach them. This test
 * re-derives the scanner set from the tree on every run, so a newly added
 * scanner fails here until it is registered rather than joining the list of
 * guards nobody notices has stopped running.
