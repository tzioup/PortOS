/**
 * Coverage guard for repo-scanning guards (issue #5055, extended by #6363).
 *
 * A handful of tests assert over the *tracked tree* rather than over anything
 * they import: they shell out to `git grep` / `git ls-files`, read the matched
 * files as text, and fail when some unrelated file anywhere in the repo breaks
 * a convention. `scripts/agent-instructions-files.test.js` is the archetype.
 *
 * A second shape has the same problem from the opposite direction: a test
 * reads ONE specific file from the *other* runner's tree with `readFileSync`
 * (a server test reading a client file, or vice versa) instead of importing
 * it — `server/lib/navManifest.js` reading 20+ client files by path, or any
 * `*.mirror.test.js` / `*.parity.test.js` diffing a server module against its
 * client copy. `pathContractTests` in `ci-test-plan.js` reaches most of these
 * by `git grep`-ing tracked tests for the changed file's basename, but only
 * when the test actually spells that basename out as a literal — a test that
 * instead resolves the path through a bare directory constant (`join(DIR,
 * someVariable)`) never names it and stays as unreachable as a #5055 scanner.
 *
 * CI selects tests by impact (`scripts/ci-test-plan.js`) through Vitest's
 * changed-source import graph, feature-path matching, or (for a named
 * text-reading contract) the basename lookup above. None of those can reach a
 * scanner or an unnamed cross-root reader: the file that violates the
 * convention is never imported by the guard and its basename never appears in
 * the guard's own source, so no edge exists to follow. The consequence is not
 * a flaky selection, it is a structural one — a scanner can sit red on `main`
 * indefinitely while every PR reports green, which is exactly what happened
 * to the agent-instructions guard.
 *
 * `ALWAYS_RUN_TESTS` (or a `STRUCTURALLY_SELECTED` entry naming a real
 * selector) is the only mechanism that can reach either shape. This test
 * re-derives both sets from the tree on every run, so a newly added scanner —
 * or a newly added unnamed cross-root reader — fails here until it is
 * registered, rather than joining the list of guards nobody notices has
 * stopped running.
