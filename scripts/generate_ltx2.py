"""PortOS bridge to dgrauet/ltx-2-mlx pipelines.

Translates the PortOS spawn-protocol used by `mlx_video.generate_av` into the
dgrauet `ltx_pipelines_mlx` Python API. Lives in the ltx-2-mlx venv (see
scripts/setup-image-video.sh INSTALL_LTX2 path) and is invoked by the Node
videoGen service when the selected model has `runtime: 'ltx2'` in
data/media-models.json.

Why a wrapper at all (vs. spawning `ltx-2-mlx <subcommand>` directly):
  - The dgrauet CLI uses bare `print(...)` and `tqdm` for progress; PortOS's
    queue dispatcher parses `STAGE:`, `STATUS:`, `DOWNLOAD:` prefixed lines
    out of stderr to drive SSE. We translate by emitting our prefixes around
    pipeline boundaries (load_models / encode / denoise / decode / save).
  - PortOS already has FFLF / extend / image / text mode semantics that map
    to different pipeline classes here. Putting the dispatch in Python keeps
    the Node side simple — one helper, four subcommands, identical contract
    to the existing `python -m mlx_video.generate_av` invocation.

Modes (class names shown new→old; we resolve whichever the installed pin has):
  text   → TI2VidOneStagePipeline / TextToVideoPipeline .generate_and_save
  image  → TI2VidOneStagePipeline / ImageToVideoPipeline .generate_and_save (--image)
  fflf   → KeyframeInterpolationPipeline.generate_and_save (--image start, --last-image end)
  extend → RetakePipeline / ExtendPipeline .extend_from_video (--extend-from-video, --extend-frames, --direction)
  a2v    → A2VidPipelineTwoStage / AudioToVideoPipeline .generate_and_save (--audio, optional --image)
  ic     → ICLoraPipeline.generate_and_save (--ic-mode, --ic-lora-path, --ic-reference)

IC-LoRA remix modes (--mode ic):
  The IC ("In-Context") pipeline conditions generation on a *reference video*
  channel (VideoConditionByReferenceLatent) with a per-mode IC-LoRA fused into
  the Stage-1 transformer. One pipeline class, several capabilities selected by
  which IC-LoRA weight you fuse — so `--ic-mode` is a label PortOS carries for
  logging/validation, not a different code path. `control` drives structure and
  motion from a depth/pose/edge clip; future modes (ingredients, colorize) reuse
  the same runner with a different weight and reference count.

Pin compatibility — class renames + frame_rate:
  The v0.14.x line of ltx-2-mlx renamed every public pipeline class and
  switched the output-rate keyword from `fps` to `frame_rate`. PortOS pins a
  specific commit (see scripts/setup-image-video.sh LTX2_PIN), but installs
  upgrade on their own schedule, so this bridge resolves both the pipeline
  class (_resolve_pipeline) and the rate keyword (_rate_kwargs) from the live
  API — old and new pins both work.

Output: writes the rendered .mp4 to --output. Emits a final JSON line on
stdout ({"video_path": "<output>"}) so the Node parent can read the result
metadata, mirroring the contract used by mlx_video.generate_av.

Exit strategy — os._exit(0) in main():
  At LTX2 pins past the upstream May-9 refactor, Metal command-buffer
  completion handlers hold the GIL through CPython frame teardown, stalling
  every Distilled/Extend/two-stage render 5-15 min after "Decoding done".
  The .mp4 is already on disk and stdout flushed before we exit, so skipping
  the normal deallocator teardown is safe and saves up to 15 min per render.

# frame-0 rows an image-to-video render pins to the supplied picture — live in

# the renoise leaves the anchor clean only on the terminal step. The clip that
# comes out is plausible and coherent; it just isn't the picture the user handed
# in, and nothing in the output says so.
#
# PortOS does not own the pin, so the invariant is enforced rather than assumed:
#
#   1. a pin whose own ancestral loop re-applies the mask after the renoise is
#      used as-is ("native");
#   2. a pin that does not gets a clean-room hook at the sampler seam — the same
#      re-application, expressed through the pin's OWN `apply_denoise_mask`, and
#      idempotent, so it cannot fight a loop that already does it ("hook"); and
#   3. a pin that exposes neither is REFUSED before any weights load, because
#      the alternative is silently shipping an unanchored clip.
#
# Scoped to `--mode image`: that is the only mode whose whole promise is "the

    """IC-LoRA reference-conditioned generation (control / ingredients / colorize).

    ICLoraPipeline is a two-stage distilled pipeline whose Stage 1 fuses an
    IC-LoRA and appends the reference clip(s) as VideoConditionByReferenceLatent
    tokens; Stage 2 reloads a clean transformer and refines at 2x. The flavor
    (control/ingredients/colorize) is entirely a function of WHICH IC-LoRA
    weight is fused — same class, same call — so `--ic-mode` only drives
    validation + status prose here.

    Notes:
      - `--ic-lora-path` may be a local .safetensors OR an HF repo id; the
        pipeline's own _resolve_lora_path handles the download. PortOS normally
        pre-fetches the weight through its HF-cache surface so the pull shows up
        with progress instead of stalling silently mid-render.
      - `reference_downscale_factor` is read off the LoRA's safetensors metadata
        by the pipeline (Union-Control ships 2, halving the reference clip), and
        it requires height/width divisible by that factor. A mismatch raises
        inside the pipeline; we surface the resolution rule in the error so the
        user knows to nudge the dimensions rather than the reference.
      - User LoRAs stack ON TOP of the IC-LoRA rather than replacing it: the
        IC-LoRA rides `lora_paths` (fused by _fuse_loras before Stage 1) while
        user LoRAs ride the separate `_pending_loras` hook, so an
        Ingredients x Character stack composes.
      - Ingredients is MULTI-reference (2-8) and conditions on stills, but the
        reference channel is a video encoder end-to-end: iclora_utils probes each
        reference with ffprobe and feeds it to the video VAE, whose reshape needs
        a (1 + 8k)-frame input. PortOS therefore materializes each still into a
        tiny 9-frame constant clip before invoking this helper, so `--ic-reference`
        is uniformly a video path regardless of the weight's reference kind.
