"""The argv, grid and adapter contract both generative video-upscale runners share.

#6511 promises ONE argument set for both backends: `buildLtxUpscaleArgs()` in
`server/services/videoGen/renderArgs.js` emits a single argv whichever runtime
the plan resolved, and only the interpreter and script path differ. #6512 (MLX)
and #6513 (CUDA) each implement that contract against a different runtime, so a
second copy of it in each runner would be two tables free to drift — exactly the
failure the flag-passed reference bounds already exist to prevent.

What lives here is the part that is genuinely identical: the parser, the model
grid, and the header-only reads of the IC-LoRA adapter. What stays with each
runner is what actually differs — the runtime it imports, the host it gates on,
the pack layout it validates, and the rename maps its own loader fuses through.

Everything here is stdlib-only, deliberately. These are the checks that run
BEFORE a GPU, an MLX wheel, or a 68 GB model pack is committed, which is what
makes the whole contract testable on a machine that has none of them.

# land on that grid at HALF the output (see `assert_reference_scale_fits`), so
# the OUTPUT axis must be divisible by 64 — which is also what upstream's own
# `assert_resolution(..., is_two_stage=True)` demands of the request both
# runners make (`conditioned_stage_request` below). Temporal compression is 8

# with a floor of 9.

# resampled — which for an upscaler means conditioning on a blurred source.
